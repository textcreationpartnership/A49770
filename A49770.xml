            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is not for Protection this little Treatiſe preſumes to

be its Guard; its Errand<pb facs="tcp:61834:3"/>is only to repreſent the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Cauſes of the Poverty of your Country, by diſcovering not only the grand
Robbers of its Treaſure, but the leſſer Theeves that creep in at every
window, and pilfer every Houſe, and pick every Pocket, whereby not only the
noble and wealthy, but the mean and poor are daily made poorer; and it
chuſeth to make its Addreſs to your Lordship, as the chief Concernee, of a
Subject, in its Proſperity, as being Heir to the higheſt Honor and moſt
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Patrimony in this Ile, and from thence will probably be in the beſt
Capacity, after a few more years have ripened your pregnant Parts, to do it
good or hurt; and amongſt the other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Vertues you derive from 
<pb facs="tcp:61834:3"/>your moſt noble Anceſtors, it is wish'd and hop'd this may be
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd, that you are a true Lover of your Country, that it may be ſaid of
you in after ages, as of <hi>Mordecai</hi> the noble Jew, <hi>He was next to
the King great amongſt his people, accepted of the multitude, ſeeking</hi>
the Wealth <hi>of his</hi> Country: your Predeceſſors have ſav'd you a
labour as to the raiſing your own Houſe, one Stone more would make that
top-heavy, all you have left to do is to keep that in repair, and to finish the
Structures they have begun for the Wealth and Proſperity of your Country; for
as they have been called to the higheſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys by their Prince, ſo have
they not diſdained to ſtoop to the meaneſt Service for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement 
<pb facs="tcp:61834:4"/>of the Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of their Country, the many
charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Attempts made by them for the erecting and incouraging
Manufactures, <hi>&amp;c. Chappellizod, Clonmell, Carrick,</hi> and about
twelve places more, where Attempts have been made by their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and

improve the Manufactures and Trade of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and this little Book
will inform them why they ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no better. I am not unſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible the
ſcornful uſeleſs Wits of this Age will inſinuate to your Lordship,
Mercantile and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick Studies are below your Dignity; but let me reply,
they have but depraved Fancies that tell you ſo; ask your moſt noble 
<pb facs="tcp:61834:4"/>Grandfather why he hath admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch free acceſs. and ſpent
ſo much time in conference with men of Mechanick and Mercan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Rank and
Breeding, he will tell you, it was that he might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Intereſt
and Intrigue of Trade to promote it, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly means to improve the Wealth
of his Country; and both divine and prophane Hiſtory informs us, moſt of
the uſeful and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Arts, wherewith the world flourisheth, were the
Inventions of famous men: It is recorded to the praiſe of <hi>Tuball
Caan,</hi> a Prince in his time, that <hi>he was the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructer of
every Artificer to work in Braſs, and Iron;</hi> &amp;c. and of holy
<hi>Noah,</hi> the laſt King of the old World, that God inſtructed him to
be his chief Ship-Carpenter,<pb facs="tcp:61834:5"/>
               <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 6.14.
<hi>Bezaleele</hi> and <hi>Aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab</hi> were Princes of their Tribes, whom God
<hi>filled with wiſdom, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and knowledge in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of
Workmanship, to deviſe cunning works. to work in</hi> Gold <hi>and</hi>
Silver, <hi>and in</hi> Braſs, <hi>in cutting of</hi> Stones, <hi>and carving
of</hi> Timber, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.45. So <hi>Solomon, Iſraels</hi> moſt

both Gods Houſe and his own, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver of his Ships to manage his
Traffique with Ophir for Gold, whereby he became the wealthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Prince in
the world; and ſo great a veneration had the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Heathens for profitable
and uſeful Arts, they attributed the Invention of them to their Gods; ſo
that moſt acute Wit, and<pb facs="tcp:61834:5"/>compleateſt States-man of his age, Sir

Qualifications, as that he was a wiſe and wary Prince, ſolidly not formally
ſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſaith, <hi>He was a great Cherisher of manual Arts,
whereby he drew to him from all parts the moſt exquiſite Artificers, gave
them ſettled Penſions, and placed them in ſeveral compart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his
Palace, where he would come often to ſee them work for his own delight, being
in truth the greateſt Oeconomiſt of his age; and as he had much of the

<hi>Phiſiologica</hi> from <hi>pag.</hi> 91. to <hi>pag.</hi> 146.</p>

Lords, my midnight Studies to make our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries flourish, and out-vie</hi>

            <p>The deſpiſing the Study of Mechanick Arts is only the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct

            <p>Sir, it is not the Art of the Tradeſman, but the Knowledge of
the Stateſman I recommend to your Study: For though it be not neceſſary
your Lordship should underſtand when Leather<pb facs="tcp:61834:8"/>is well tanned, or
Wool well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, or Flesh and Fish with their products well ſaved, nor
when Cloth &amp; Stuff is true made, yet it is very convenient, your Noble
Self, and others like to be concerned with you in State Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, should be
acquainted how much the right Managing thoſe leſſer matters tends to the
Credit and Wealth of your Country, and that the Labour of the poor, when
rightly improved, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth greater Wealth to a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try than the Revenue of
the rich, as is evident in the Chapter of Manufactures.</p>
            <p>And as your Lordship may be eminently ſerviceable herein in your
publick ſtation, when you come to be a Chief Miniſter of State, ſo at
preſent by your lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<pb facs="tcp:61834:8"/>Example in being the chief Member of that
honourable So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, propoſed for curing all our Mercantile maladies in the
Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Corporation-Trade,</hi> few ſober young Gentlemen but would
eſteem it their Honour as well as their Intereſt to be ingaged with you in
a work ſo beneficial to their Country, and convenient to themſelves; for it
is the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Princes and Nobles to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque themſelves in Deſigns for
the publick Weal of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, wherein your Lordship hath Royal as well as
Noble examples in the members of the <hi>African</hi> and <hi>Canary</hi>
Companies at <hi>London, &amp;c.</hi> and it is recorded, to the Honor of the
Lord Chancellor <hi>Cromwel,</hi> after his grateful Requital of his old Friend
<hi>Francis Friſcobald,</hi> a<pb facs="tcp:61834:9"/>decayed Banker of
<hi>Florence,</hi> that he highly importuned him to ſtay and erect a new Bank
in <hi>London,</hi> offering to go a share with him to the value of 60000
Duckats, a conſiderable Sum in thoſe times.</p>
            <p>And this work of improving <hi>Ireland</hi> in Trade and
Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures ſeems to be reſerved for the Age your Lordship is to act your
part on the publick Stage; for, as I demonſtrate in the firſt Chapter,
<hi>Ireland</hi> was never ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it until the year 1660. and ſince then
many hopeful Attempts have miſcarried for want of diſcerning the Defects in
their Foundation, for which Experience ſince then hath ſupplied Remedies,
which this little Book propoſes; that as your moſt Illuſtrious
Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<pb facs="tcp:61834:9"/>hath had the Honor to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and ſettle the real
Eſtates of this Kingdom, a work of that weight and difficulty, few Heads or
Hands but his own could have performed ſo, to the general ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of
all the different op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Intereſts; ſo will it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be your
Lordships work to build upon that well laid Foundation, by improving the
perſonal Eſtates of <hi>Irelands</hi> Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, which nothing but the
propagating its <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures</hi> can do, and that is a
<hi>Work</hi> will proſper in no hand but that of <hi>Intereſt,</hi> as is
aſſerted in the Chapter of <hi>Irelands Intereſt in its own
Government:</hi> and none will queſtion but your Lordship hath the greateſt
Intereſt in <hi>Irelands</hi> Proſperity of any Subject in the<pb facs="tcp:61834:10"/>Kings Dominions; and as your Intereſt, ſo your natural Genius, if
your obſerves miſtake not, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines you to Seriouſneſs, a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per this
frothy age needs your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in; and it is hop'd by them that love you, it is
not only the gravity of your paternal Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Example, but the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of
your own innate ſolid Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that hath preſerved you to this age ſo
ſpotleſs, wherein too many young Noblemen are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobly vicious, to the
reproach of their Dignities: titular Honour abſtracted from Vertue is but the
shadow of Greatneſs, vertuous and heroick Actions are the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of
it.</p>

            <p>I Have reaſon to ſuſpect, all to whom I am known will marvel
to ſee me in Print at this time of day, and the more at the freedom I take
both as to perſons and things, for whoſe Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and my own
Vindication, I think my ſelf bound to give the following account as to my
motives thereto.</p>
            <p>That having been in this Kingdom <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> next 33 years,
one third of my time in a publick capacity in the Civil as well as Military
Affairs, and obſerving my Ignorance of the State, Temper and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution 
<pb facs="tcp:61834:19"/>of the Country diſabled me from being capable of giving ſuch
an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſeveral buſineſſes put upon me as was requiſite, I
addicted my ſelf to the ſtudy both of Books and Men of the beſt and
longeſt experience in the civil Conſtitution of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by whom I
gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome knowledge and inſpection, and committed my Obſervations to
Writing.</p>
            <p>That for near twenty years paſt, in my more private capacity, as
a member of the Council of Trade, where moſt of the particulars reſpecting
Trade I publiſh in this, and deſign in my <hi>Treatiſe of Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique,
&amp;c.</hi> were deliberated by perſons of the higheſt Characters for
Parts and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in this Kingdom; amongſt whom I found my ſelf but a
Novice in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks and methods of Trade; which put me upon ſtudying the
ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and Queſtions there propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not daring to give
my Opinion in ſo honorable and learned an Aſſembly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Book, which
engaged me to read much Hiſtory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to find the Opinion and
Practice of paſt times in the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive caſes there debated, in

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61834:23"/>But the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> leaving the
Government before a Parliament met, or thoſe capable of forming into Acts of
State, performed or put in practice; as the Council of Trade was their
Nurſery, ſo the Council-Table became their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, where they remain in
their Urn to this day, and not like to have a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection whilſt the
Realm is under ſuch a conſternation; and conſequently the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
incumbered with the variety of Affairs relating to the preſervation of the
whole; as theſe late horrid Popiſh Plots have brought us under.</p>
            <p>For before the Dukes removal moſt of the Privy Council, and
other principal Miniſters of State ſeemed exceeding fond of all propoſals
tending to the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Trade and Manufacture of the Nation, and
reſolved to put the Act of Parliament for the Linnen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in practice
at <hi>Chappelizod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And although I gave my Opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Report in the
Council of Trade, and my Argument at Council-Table againſt the practice of
that Act until a Parliament met to mend it; yet they were pleaſed not only to
make an<pb facs="tcp:61834:23"/>Experiment in the caſe, but alſo to pitch upon my
ſelf (admitting of no excuſe) to manage it; which, after three or four
months ſollicitation, I only ſubmitted to until ſome other fit perſon
could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured: but the Duke removing, what Diſcouragements I received,
and Loſs and Damage I ſuſtained under the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of his Succeſſors
I ſhall give an Account of in my <hi>Treatiſe of Manufacture,</hi> which
will give ſome further Evidence of the difference betwixt a Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
governed by perſons peculiarly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in its proſperity, and others
Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens to its peculiar Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Now having been ſo long and ſo much engaged in the Affairs of
<hi>Ireland</hi> of this nature, and being hopeleſs to live to ſee ſuch a
vigorous Spirit for <hi>Irelands</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement revived in the Government,
as was from the year 64. to the year 69. leſt the ſucceeding Generation
ſhould be diſcouraged attempting <hi>Irelands</hi> Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Trade
and Manufactures, from the common Fame of ſo many Miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages in theſe
former Attempts, I thought it my duty to leave theſe Memoires for their
Information: though I ſhould have<pb facs="tcp:61834:24"/>been glad a more polite pen had
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it: yet having taken ſo much pains, ſpent ſo much time, and
attained ſo much dear bought Experience in this Affair, I ſhall ſubmit
the cenſure of my integrity and prudence in this publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the
charitable judicious, and ſlight the Reflections of others.</p>
            <p>In Matter of Fact I have not preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuouſly erred, ſparing
no pains to find out the Truth, by Inquiſition of the moſt knowing
perſons, and ſearching all Records and Hiſtories I could come at: yet in
an Affair conſiſting of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Heads ſome miſtakes may happen; but
if I have over-eſtimated ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, others are as much under; and
if I do allow Five hundred thouſand pounds deduction from the Ballance of our
fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years Conſumption, computed <hi>Ch.</hi> 4. the Remain is
ſufficient to move the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to take the Conſumption into
conſideration.</p>
            <p>For my intruding upon politicks of Government. I endeavour to
confine my ſelf within the verge of ſuch particulars, as have a ſtrong
ruling influence over the Trade and Wealth of a Country,<pb facs="tcp:61834:24"/>and the
moſt apt Mediums to improve a Kingdom or State in Trade without proper Maxims
and ſuitable practice in Rulers, can never reach their Deſigns, the whole
ſucceſs of Trade depends upon the Principles and Inclinations of the
ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling part of a State.</p>
            <p>For my Reflections on Principles of Religion, I deſigned only to
hint thoſe that relate to the civil Policy and Peace of the Kingdom; and I
think I have confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſelf within that verge, not touching on one
Controverſie betwixt Proteſtants; inſiſting only upon the uncharitable,
nay, I may ſay, unchriſtian Severities and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures practiſed by the
rigid of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to the grief and burden of the more pious and
moderate.</p>
            <p>Empty Casks make the greateſt ſound, which I only reprove; and
plead for a charitable Union wherein we agree, in order to the Promulgation of
our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Faith, and Preſervation of the common Proteſtant Intereſt of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61834:25"/>And I judge the Proſperity of the Trade and Wealth
of <hi>Ireland</hi> is much concerned therein; as is ſtated in my
Supplement.</p>
            <p>What I obſerve of the bloody Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Practices of the
Papiſts is but Hiſtorical, being Collections out of authentick Authors,
moſt of their own; and that only to theſe ends.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To awaken ſome drowſie Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, who ſeem to
be lulling aſleep on <hi>Dallilahs</hi> Lap, where they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to have
their Locks cut, wherein their great ſtrength lies; and then will ſoon
follow, <hi>The Philiſtines be upon thee, Sampſon.</hi> It is grievous to
obſerve how many Proteſtants greedily lick up the Papiſts Debaucheries;
as if they were vying which ſhould fill up the meaſure of our Iniquity
ſooneſt, and provoke a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God moſt, to ſend new deſolating
Judgments upon us; not conſidering that this is the Jeſuited Papiſts
method, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch in Manners in order to corrupt in Principle; knowing that
when Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence<pb facs="tcp:61834:25"/>is feared by a cuſtom of Sins againſt the
ſecond Table Precepts, all Religions will ſoon be alike to ſuch. And the
mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not great to themſelves which they chooſe: for God hath
determined that no impenitent Drunkard, Adulterer, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Swearer,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3. <hi>Acts</hi>
3.19.7.13. whether they be Papiſts, Proteſtants, or Diſſenters from
both; but of all Religions in the world, if you reſolve to ſpend your days
<hi>in riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and exceſs, in chambering and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> &amp;c. and
venture your Souls on a death bed Repentance, be Papiſts, where Pardon of Sin
is ſaid to be obtained, at leaſt, purchaſed by a meer verbal
Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, tho' there be no Contrition appear, nor profeſt purpoſe to
reform, if you live, as I evidence in my Supplement from their own Authors.</p>
            <p>But let all this ſort of Proteſtants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, the
Papiſts in <hi>October</hi> and <hi>November</hi> 1641. made no diſtinction
betwixt the preciſe and prophane; the Proteſtant and the Puritan were equal
Hereticks with them, with whom no Faith is to be kept,<pb facs="tcp:61834:26"/>nor Mercy to
be ſhown, when their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction tends to the Advancement of the Catholick
Cauſe.</p>
            <p>My ſecond End is to warn the more ſerious and better
principled Papiſts, to ſave themſelves, their Families and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from
further deſolation by theſe Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itical bloody Principles; whereby ſome
of their Prieſts have ſo often brought upon them, and are now again
plotting to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs their total ruine and deſtruction; and had before this
in all probability cauſed <hi>Ireland</hi> once more to ſwim in Blood, even
the Blood of Women and Children, and other innocent perſons, both of
Papiſts and Proteſtants, if God had not touch'd the Hearts of ſome of
their own Prieſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be Diſcoverers.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſince it is manifeſt, all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts are not
poyſoned with <hi>Triden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> bloody Principles; pity it is the more
Innocent ſhould be involved in the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys and miſchiefs of the
Guilty.</p>
            <p>And that leſs than a total extirpation<pb facs="tcp:61834:26"/>of
Proteſtantiſm or Popery can be the iſſue of the next Rebellion is
irrational to believe; and as irrational to think it is poſſible for the
Papiſts to carry the day, if they conſider the Diſadvantage they are now
under above what they were in 1641. And therefore have I aſſerted it their
Safety and Intereſt to promote the potency of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Intereſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, as the only Medium to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their future
Calamity.</p>
            <p>The Searcher of Hearts knows I have not the leaſt Gall or
prejudice againſt Papiſts <hi>quia</hi> Papiſts: I have many inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Acquaintance and kind Friends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them with whom I willingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
kindneſſes, whoſe ruine and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery would greatly afflict me: and
hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of them yet living will and daily do acknowledge, when it was in the
power of my Hand to do them harm, it was in my Heart to do them good: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of
them have removed out of other Precincts to come under my Government and
Protection; and in the time of the firſt Court of Claims addreſſed
themſelves<pb facs="tcp:61834:27"/>to me, as their common Sollicitor, if they had but the
leaſt pretence to Innocency or of Kindneſs ſhewn to the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> in their diſtreſs: and as it never was, ſo it is not
now my deſign to incenſe their <hi>Engliſh</hi> Neighbours againſt
them; but ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rejoyce to further an increaſing neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly
Friendſhip betwixt them on equal and ſafe terms, much leſs is it my
prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, or the leaſt of my deſign to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Government to
perſecute them, deſiring to walk by that Golden rule, to do to others as I
would they ſhould do to me: all I aim at is to lay before the eyes of them
ſound in Morals the pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of thoſe Jeſuitical Principles,
which I have reaſon to ſuſpect they have never read or heard of, and if
they did, never ſeriouſly conſider the malignant nature and deſperate
conſequences of them; though they have not only made <hi>Ireland</hi> but all
Chriſtendom ſwim in Blood, as appears <hi>Supplement Sect.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>And that torrent can never be ſtop'd, nor <hi>Irelands</hi>
Peace never ſecured, until theſe bloody ſavage <hi>Tridentine</hi>
principles<pb facs="tcp:61834:27"/>are renounced: ſurely the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church was
more Catholick before <hi>Ignatius Loyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> broach'd his helliſh
Doctrines than it can be ſince: for the better half of the Chriſtians of
<hi>Europe</hi> then in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion are ſince broken off; he being the
firſt of their Fathers that vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintained and rebelliouſly
defended the Popes Supremacy over Emperors and Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo far
as to proclaim it lawful, nay meritorious, to deſtroy its oppoſers; a
Doctrine that hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded, and its Propagaters baniſhed by all the
Princes and States of their own Religion, when they have found their own
Eſtates in danger by it; as I ſhew in my Supplement.</p>
            <p>And why they who ſo much glory in their Antiquity, and ſo
frequently chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge our Proteſtant Divines, to ſhew them where our
Religion was before <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> ſhould imbibe a Religion they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſhew where it was before <hi>Loyola,</hi> ſo many years his
<hi>junior,</hi> is hard to give the reaſon of; unleſs it be this one, that
ſince the Light of the Goſpel hath ſhined<pb facs="tcp:61834:28"/>in the world, their
Deeds of Darkneſs could no ways be hid, nor defended ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Scripture or
Reaſon, only by bloody War and cruel Inquiſition, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the
Lives of their Opponents in order to ſhut their eyes and ſtop their mouths.
And having thus far endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to vindicate my ſelf againſt the cenſure
of Preſumption in treating upon Politicks, and from uncharitable Severity in
my Deſcants on Religion, I ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the whole to the Judgment of the
charitable judicious; and for the reſt, as much ſlight their Cenſure, as
they deſpiſe my Labour.</p>

that the Popish Minors had been at work under ground all along and the 23. of
<hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1641. was the day agreed on to ſpring their Mine: for in

                     <p>So that though <hi>Ireland</hi> had no open War from the
year 1600. to the year 1641. yet theſe ſeveral at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts continued an
inward Dread on the minds of the <hi>English,</hi> which diſcouraged their
Induſtry in Trade and Manufactures, and what they had of Trade were chiefly
in the hand of the <hi>Irish</hi> who had little Manufacture but Rugs, Mantles
and Frizes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And from the year 1641. to the year 1660. I may ſpare
troubling you with an account why <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was not improved in Trade
and Wealth; for thirteen years of the nineteen were ſpent in violent and
bloody War, and that monſter devours every thing but it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>And for the other ſix years the new Landlords of
Adventurers and Souldiers had their Heads and their Hands full, in procuring
and ſetling their new E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.</p>
                     <p>And not only themſelves, but moſt perſons that could
command Mony, fell a trading in Debentures, and thereby obtained better
Eſtates in one year, than by treble the ſum they ever got in ſeven years
before by Traffick.</p>
                     <p>So that until the year 1660. <hi>Irelands</hi> not
improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Trade and Manufactures should not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Attempts now: for
had the Country been much more capable than it is; and, I judge, few Countries
in the World better qualified as to its Scituation, and natural Product, yet
was there no encouragement for attempting any conſiderable Trade and
Manufactures thus far.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61834:49"/>And what hath ſince obſtructed the
increaſe of Trade, and fruſtrated all attempts propagating the Manufactures
of <hi>Ireland. Vid.</hi> the Chapter of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Impediment ariſeth from the former, the
unſetledneſs of the minds of the people; for a people inured to War, rather
diſpoſe their minds to idleneſs and rapine, than innocent Induſtry; and
what is quickly ſo gained, is uſually as ſoon ſpent in riot and
exceſs: And as theſe ſort of people hate honeſt labour and induſtry
themſelves, ſo do they by their frequent robberies diſcourage others;
that when a years induſtry shall be forced out of their hands by an hours
robbery, they conclude eaſe and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour will be all one at the years end; and
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chooſe ſcarcity, with eaſe and ſafety, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than by
labour to gain a little matter about them; which will but make them the more
ſit Prey for the violence of Wood-kearns and Thieves.</p>
                     <p>The third Impediment is the great plenty of proviſions,
for fulneſs of Bread is the cauſe of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of idleneſs in
<hi>Ireland</hi> as well as in <hi>Sodom;</hi> which argument I shall chooſe
to give you in the words of our Ingenious Countreyman Sir <hi>William
Temple,</hi> in his Obſervation on the Trade of <hi>Holland, pag.</hi> 187,
188. as followeth: <hi>Since the ground of Trade cannot be produced from
Havens, or native Commodities, as may well be concluded from the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of</hi> Holland, <hi>which has the leaſt and the worſt; and of</hi>
Ireland, <hi>which hath the moſt, and the beſt of both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61834:50"/>it were not amiſs to conſider from what other ſcore it
may be more naturally and certainly derived; for if we talk of Induſtry, we
are ſtill as much to ſeek what it is that makes a people induſtrious in
one Country and idle in another: I conceive the true original ground of Trade
to be great multitudes of People crowded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſmall compaſs of Land,
whereby all things neceſſary to life become dear, and all men who have
poſſeſſions are induced to Parcemony, but thoſe who have none are
forced to Induſtry and Labour, or elſe to want: Bodies that are vigorous
fall to labour, ſuch as are not ſupply that defect by ſome ſort of
Inventions or Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity: Thoſe cuſtoms ariſe firſt from neceſſity,
but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe by imitation, and grow in time habitual in a Country; and where
they are ſo, if it is upon the Sea, they naturally break out into Trade, both
becauſe whatſoever they want of their own that is neceſſary, ſo many
mens lives muſt be ſupplyed from abroad; and becauſe by the multitude of
People, and ſmalneſs of a Country, I and grows dear, that the Improvement
of Mony that way is conſiderable, and ſo turns to Sea, where the
greatneſs of the Profit makes amends for the Venture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This cannot be better illuſtrated than by its
contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which appears no where more than in</hi> Ireland, <hi>whereby the
largeneſs and plenty of the Soil, and ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the People, all things
neceſſary to Life are ſo ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ap, that an induſtrious man by two days labour may gain enough to
feed him the reſt of the week, which I take to be a very plain ground of
Lazineſs attributed to the people; for men naturally prefer Eaſe before
Labour, and will not take pains, if they can live idle; <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61834:50"/>though when by neceſſity they have been uſed to it, they cannot
leave it, being grown a cuſtom neceſſary to their Health, and to their
very Entertainment: nor perhaps is the change harder, from conſtant Eaſe to
Labour, than from conſtant Labour to Eaſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Impediment is the Height of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of
Mony; for <hi>Holland</hi> that hath Mony at three <hi>per Cent.</hi> and
<hi>England</hi> at ſix, eat up Traders in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where Mony is
difficult to be procured at ten; whereby the one will underfell the other at
his own doors, and run them down in Manufactures at home, and Markets abroad;
having alſo the advantage of better and cheaper Workmen. The dearneſs of
Proviſions neceſſitating their poor to work, the ſame neceſſity
moves them to inure their Children to Art from their Cradles, whereby they will
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form more and better in one day than ours in two.</p>
                     <p>The fifth Impediment is the lowneſs of the rate of Land;
for when a man may purchaſe a better Rent for 1000 pound in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
than he can for two in <hi>England,</hi> or three in <hi>Holland,</hi> or
proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Farm. What prudent man will undergo the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and run
the Hazards of Trade, when he may diſpoſe of his Mony with much more eaſe
and ſafety to his better advantage: and from hence it is we have ſo few
wealthy Merchants in this Country: for if a man begin with a 1000 pound, and
improve it to 9 or 10. in Trade, like wary Gameſters that have won at Play,
they will venture no more, but lay out their Mony in Land, and of a rich
Merchant become a Country Gentleman: and then parting<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61834:51"/>with a
few Guineys to procure a Dub, or Patent, the Knights Son will blush if you tell
him his Father got his Eſtate by converſing with Tarpolins,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which brings me to the ſixth Impediment, The low eſteem
the generous Calling of a Merchant hath in this Countrey, where every pedling
Shopkeeper and Pettyfogger is ſtil'd a Merchant; that <hi>Ireland</hi> breeds
Merchants as Beggars do lice, from its pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and idleneſs: For turning
Merchant is the laſt shift a laſie Mechanick or a beggerly Citizen takes
to; whereas every Trade ought to bear the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of their peculiar
Faculty. For though Clothiers, Drapers, Mercers, Milliners, Ironmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
Grocers, Haberdashers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipful Rank, and
principal Citizens, yet they are not Merchants; for none are properly Merchants
but the Adventurers at Sea; from whence the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Corporation of
Merchants in <hi>London</hi> was ſtiled the Company of Merchant Adventurers:
But from this degrading of the reputation of Merchants, that Honourable Calling
is of ſo low repute, that few Gentlemen, much leſs Noblemen, will put their
Sons Apprentice to a Merchant, but rather breed them for Divines, Souldiers,
Lawyers, Phyſicians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though it may happen, under thoſe
Profeſſions, they never attain to be eminent; that had they put another Son
to a Merchant, the Divine might have been glad to become his Brother's
Chaplain. Whereas in all Countries flourishing in Trade, their Nobles and chief
Citizens are Merchants; as <hi>Venice, Florence, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa, Lisbon, Amſt.</hi>
and <hi>Lond.</hi> where his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; many of the Nobles about
Court are inrolled<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61834:51"/>Merchants in the <hi>Affrican</hi> and
<hi>Canary</hi> Companies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which his Royal Highneſs hath
Honoured with bearing Office,<note n="†" place="margin">Blooms
<hi>Geography, in his Cha. of Traffick,</hi> pag. 50.</note> 
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And this is no novelty; for <hi>Solomon,</hi> the moſt glorious King of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> was a Merchant; it was his Traffick, not his Crown-Rents, by
which <hi>he made Silver to be as Stones in</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, <hi>and Cedars
as the Sicamore</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Kings, Chap.</hi> 10.
<hi>ver.</hi> 27.</note>.</p>
                     <p>And the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> recording the glory of old
<hi>Tyre,</hi> calls her <hi>the Crowning City, and Mart of Nations, whoſe
Merchants were Princes, whoſe Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fickers are the Honourable of the

                        <note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Iſa.</hi> 23. <hi>ver.</hi>
8.</note>. And this high eſteem and noble reputation Merchants hath had both
in ancient and modern times in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, knowing the worth of Trade, hath
commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them for <hi>Counſellors</hi> and principal Miniſters of State
to Princes and chief <hi>Senators</hi> in all Common-wealths, whereby the
intereſt of Trade hath been greatly promoted, and perſons of Honour
encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſtudy it as a principal piece of State-policy to know how to
encreaſe their own and leſſen their neighbours Trade; the advantage
thereof we have a notorious example in the modern Politicks of <hi>France,</hi>

that aſpiring Prince is not only become ſo powerful on Land, but ſo

                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61834:52"/>The ſeventh Impediment is the
lowneſs of the Credit of the Tradeſmen of this Countrey, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from
their ill performances with their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors abroad, which they are
neceſſitated unto from theſe three Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, from the Delatorineſs of Common-Law Proceedings
in our ordinary Courts of Juſtice, where a man may be a year before he obtain
Judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Specialty, and much longer upon a Book-debt, eſpecially if
either the Defendant or his Sollicitor be well acquainted with Quirks in
Law-proceedings: To prevent which, all Countreys flourishing in Trade keep
their Court Merchant, which within a few days, by a Summery way of proceeding
by the Law Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>catore, will
determine a Cauſe.<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Lex Mercatoria</hi> pag. 458,
&amp;c.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond Cauſe of the lowneſs of their Credit, is
the ſmalneſs of the Stocks of our Tradeſmen: A perſon of
500<abbr>l.</abbr> Stock shall accept of 2000<abbr>l.</abbr> Credit, which by
reaſon of Goods lying upon hand, and Debts out, he is no ways able to comply
with time; but what he buys at ſix months, may be three 6 months unpaid, and
that intails him upon his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor; though his Goods be bad, and dear, he dare
not leave him, being at his mercy for old ſcores.</p>
                     <p>The third and chief Cauſe is, from the bad pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſome
of the Gentry make to the Trader, whereby the Trading Stock of the Nation is
ſtopt in its courſe, like the Blood ſtopt in its circulation, threatens
the ruine of the Body by variety of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
                     <p>For when the Gentleman pays not the Mercer and Draper, he
cannot pay the Manufacturer, nor he<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61834:52"/>his Workmen, nor they
the Woolman, nor he his Landlords Rent: That could this one obſtruction to
Trade be removed, moſt others would fall in courſe.</p>
                     <p>And for removing of this Trade ruining Nation,
ſcandalizing evil, I would propoſe that no Merchant or Retayler should
recover in any of the Kings Courts any Debt contracted for foreign
Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, but that it should be admitted a ſufficient Bar againſt
Judgment, if the Debtor could prove that the Debt were contracted for Goods
manufactured out of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, This would not only reſtrain the Seller from
truſting where he had confidence of payment, but excuſe his refuſal where
he only credits, being loth to diſoblige.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This would reſtrain many Buyers, who whilſt
they can have time, will be profuſe in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences; but if every
ſuperfluous fine thing they fancy coſt them ready Money, the thought of
part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their Money would ſomething moderate their fondneſs of the
thing when they much need it not.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, This would prevent mens Wives and Daughters from
running them into debt for fine Clothes, if in ſtead of going, to the
Tradeſman to be truſted, they were conſtrained to go to him that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
the Purſe; for Money, it might admit a debate whether the thing were ſo
neceſſary as to part with preſent Money for it.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Expedient to remedy this immoral dishonourable
ruine of Trade, is for the Magiſtracy<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61834:53"/>in their places, and
Miniſters in theirs, by their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies on the Bench; and from the
Pulpit to shew the ſcandal of it, eſpecially in perſons of Honour and
Quality; it being not only a tranſgreſſion of all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine rules in the
Chriſtian World, but of all Moral rules in the Civilized World, not to do to
others as we would have others do by us. We read of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Pagan</hi>
Nations that are ſo great abhorrers of this ſort of Injuſtice, that when
their Subjects through ſloth or prodigality run more into debt than they are
able to pay, deliver them to their Creditor for Slaves until the debt be
ſatisfied, as being unworthy to enjoy the freedom of Citizens, much leſs
the dignity of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators or Magiſtrates. Saith <hi>Solomon, The
oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the poor is as a ſweeping rain.</hi> He means poor
Magiſtrates, who by vertue of their Office hath power to oppreſs: Therefore
it would be an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Law, to provide that all Noble Families decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in
Eſtate, by ſerving their King and Countrey, or other unavoidable Providence
of God, should be repaired by the benevolence of their Countrey, which were
uſual amongſt the <hi>Greecians</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> in their
proſperity.</p>
                     <p>And that others, who ruine their Eſtates by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality
and ill courſes, should be degraded from their Dignities; for noble Titles
void of noble E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and noble Qualities, renders Nobility con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
and not only the reproach, but the peſt of a Countrey. Therefore ſuch a
Court of Wards as might be intruſted with the Education of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
Nobility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo regulated by Law, that no Guardian could make a
prey of them and their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61834:53"/>and alſo impowred where
they ſaw need, to ſecure the Eſtates of Prodigals, at Age, from their
waſting courſes, for the good of their Poſterity, would be of great uſe
to this Kingdom, to ſecure it from Noble and Worshipful Bankrupts, who do not
only ruine their own Families and Poſterities, but uſually many other
induſtrious Families that had the ill hap to credit them.</p>
                     <p>The third Expedient to ſecure this Realm from this Trade
and Wealth-conſuming evil is, for the prudent and ſober part of the
Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try both by their examples and advice, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance
theſe Prodigals in their ruining cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, by their examples to bring high Gaming,
exceſſive Drinking, and all voluptuous living out of credit; for the
reaſon why ſo many young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are ſo extravagant in their expences,
is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they think their Quality and Degree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it.</p>
                     <p>Whereas true Beauties need no Paint; a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman shall
receive the reſpect of his Degree when clothed in Frieze, as fully as if
arrayed in Scarlet. I remember ſince the Ancient Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Gentry of
<hi>England,</hi> though they kept noble Houſes, went very plain
themſelves: what Bravery they had was in their Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants: And then how glad
was a Tradeſman to ſee their Stewards and Liveries coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their
Shops; whereas now they dread it in ſome of them: and if they part with their
Goods, will require the Steward or ſome of their mean Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants 
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61834:54"/>to be ſecurity for their Lord, my ſometimes Citizens;
and then, though the Lord or Maſter bears the Title, the Servant or Citizen
enjoys the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of perſons ſit to be credited; which veils the glory of
the Nobility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of <hi>Ireland;</hi> who when by the merit of
their Anceſtors, or by the King's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour they are raiſed in their degree
above others, should raiſe their minds above thoſe ignoble, vitious
principles and practices of meaner perſons, or be ſuſpended their Titles
till they do it. Shall a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer for dishonouring his Practice, have his Gown
pull'd over his Ears, and himſelf thrown over the Bar? Or if a Divine
ſcandalize his Cloath, shall he be degraded, and thereby diſgraced? And
shall a Nobleman reproach his Dignity, and the fame of his Anceſtors without
blame! Heathens did not think ſo; the <hi>Athenians</hi> had their Goddeſs
<hi>Nemeſis, being ſtiled by them the Goddeſs of Indignation,
for punishing thoſe who behaved themſelves unworthy of their degree and
fortune.</hi>

The Nobility of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are the Pillars of it, and therefore called Peers;
and if the Pillars of a Houſe be made of rotten wood, wherein then
conſiſts the ſtrength of it? Wiſe <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> when he built his

                     <p>Why is the Sentence of a Nobleman in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment admitted upon

pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes, he is as tender of his Honour, as others are of<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61834:54"/>their Conſciences: and though the Wealth of a Country is

<hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is not ſeemly for a Fool; Solomons</hi> Fools were not
Idiots, but rude vitious perſons: Honourable Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles were not deſigned to
make men Honourable that were not ſo before, but to declare to others, it was
the opinion of their Prince they deſerved Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for the worthy Service they
had done for their King and Country: When Titles of Honour are confer'd on
perſons of mean Birth, mechanick Education, and ſordid diſpoſition
without reſpect to Honourable Service, when they are neither Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials
of the Kings Favour, or the perſons Merit, it moves vertuous and worthy
perſons to ſlight them, if the moſt daring Heroick ſpirit in an Army
shall perform, in the ſight of his Prince, the moſt deſperate Service, at
his coming off he is dub'd; but whilſt the was fighting, if the baſeſt
Coward in the Army be plundering the Enemies Waggons, forſaken by their
Guard, and fill his pockets with Gold, he shall for a ſmall part of it obtain
a Patent for a Baronet, and take place of the other, as the more Honourable
Man; which lowers the rate of Fortitude the higheſt vertue, and raiſeth the
price of Covetouſneſs the moſt ſordid of vices.</p>

                     <p>IS from its exceſs in ſpending; for where much is
ſpent, and little gained, poverty and decay neceſſarily follows: And this
conſiſts in its exceſſive conſumption of foreign Commodities.

proportionably to abilities; for ſome Families may better afford to drink

<hi>England</hi> Woollen-cloth; and <hi>Florence,</hi> and moſt part of

coſts them little, conſidering they pay for them by their own Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture,
or in Goods received of other Countreys for them, which is ſtill but the
product of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; they conſume nothing of the Stock of their
Countrey. And it is the ſame with <hi>France;</hi> that Countrey would beggar
themſelves by their curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their Apparel, if they bought what they
wear, manufactured: Whereas they gain by their frequent change of Modes, by the
great Trade they thereby obtain from other Countreys diſpoſed to imitate
them. And ſo for the Belly; a Peaſant in <hi>France</hi> may drink Wine, as
cheap as a Farmer in <hi>England</hi> drinks Beer. So ſome Countreys on the
<hi>Baltick</hi>-Shore may eat <hi>Sturgion,</hi> as cheap as <hi>Ireland</hi>

Countrey conſumes, that hurts them, but the price they pay for it. A perſon
that ſpends forty Pounds <hi>per ann.</hi> in the Manufacture of the
Countrey, conſumes not ſo much of its Wealth, as another that ſpends but
ten in foreign Manufacture. For the more full demonſtration of the ruining
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this exceſſive conſumption of foreign Manufactures, I
shall propoſe to you this one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:</p>
                     <p>Of Silks; wherein the exceſs is grown to that height, that
where our Grandfathers ſpent one Shilling, we ſpend above a Pound, and
twenty to one is great odds in expences: Then if a good ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient 
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61834:57"/>Farmer that paid one hundred Pound a year Rent, or a
ſubſtantial Yeoman of fifty or ſixty Pounds <hi>per ann.</hi> in Land,
had worn any other Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than of Cloth or Stuff, produced by the hands of
his own Family, he would have been cenſured as a profuſe Perſon, and his
Wife for a ſlack Houſewife, you will find he will bring his Hogs to a fair
Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket in a little time, would his Neighbours ſay. And though Citizens went
more Gentile, yet generally grave and plain, according to their ſeveral Ranks
and Callings: But now perſons of this Rank will clothe themſelves above the
Garb of Knights in former days. Yeomen, or ordinary Tradeſmens Wives wear not
only Silk-Gowns, but oft-times two or three Silk-Petticoats appear as they
walk, one under another, which is an intollerable expence upon the Countrey.
For ſuppoſe forty thouſand Families in this Kingdom that thus wear, and
allow them but five Pound <hi>per an.</hi> each perſon, it amounts to two
hundred thouſand Pounds a year. And equal, if not more intolerable then this
of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is that univerſal practice of wearing Silk-hoods and Scarfs,
which every mean mans Wife and Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea Carmens and

conſequently one of the profitableſt. For it did not only manufacture a
great proportion of our Woolls, but employed therein a great number of
induſtrious people. And ſuppoſe the ſame num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Servants, and mean
mens Wives and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that now wear Silk-hoods, and
Scarfs, wore Hats, or Searge-hoods, at five Shillings each, the Wooll being nor
valued above half the price: the profit of the Countrey by the labour of the
peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that is now loſt, would amount unto ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred

                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> If this be ſo, how comes it <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>France,</hi> that much exceed <hi>Ireland</hi>'s expence in Garbs, and
yet both flourishing Kingdoms in Trade and Wealth?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, it is not granted they exceed
<hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the quantity and quality of the people conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; for
theſe Countreys are not only much more populous, but far more wealthy, and
although the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>France</hi> are expenſive, yet the
Peaſant, or ordinary People are reſtrained both by Law and Cuſtom to wear
the moſt ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their own Countrey. And as I obſerved before,
the State of <hi>France</hi> gains, rather than loſes, by the Garbs of
particular perſons: For they ſell more to others than pays for the foreign
matter they manufacture for themſelves. But let us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare 
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61834:58"/>our ſelves with <hi>England,</hi> the State and Garb
whereof being more generally known to us than that of <hi>France,</hi> and we
shall find we much exceed <hi>England</hi> in the profuſeneſs of our
expences this way, if the quality and quantity of perſons be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.
Firſt, <hi>England</hi> muſt be conſidered as a Family, after many years
gathering by great pains and good husbandry, in poſſeſſion of a great
well-ſetled Eſtate; but <hi>Ireland</hi> as a young Beginner, if it have
yet begun in the way to get Wealth. And if a Gentleman of a thouſand Pounds
<hi>per ann.</hi> will keep the Port, and ſpend at the rate of another of ten
thouſand Pounds <hi>per ann.</hi> the miſchief of the Parity will ſoon
appear, and <hi>England</hi> does not only poſſeſs ten times the Wealth
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but drives ten times his Trade, and twenty to one is great
odds in expences.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if <hi>England</hi> muſt be <hi>Irelands</hi>
pattern in Garbs and Expences, then review <hi>Englands</hi> Garb and Expences
when its ſtate was more ſutable to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and you will find it
very mean and homely to what <hi>Ireland</hi> is now; and as it increaſed in
Wealth, ſo in the expenſiveneſs of its Garb and Port: and ſo ſoon as
the people began to break bounds on that hand, the wiſdom of thoſe times
ſaw reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them by ſumptuary Laws; as in the 17th. of

the 8th. theſe Laws were corrected, and inlarged, with more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Penalties, and all the former Acts repealed; annexed to this Preamble: 
<q>Foraſmuch as the great and coſtly Array uſed within

occaſion of great impoverishing of the Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects / and provok'd divers

                     </p>
                     <p>It is true, as <hi>England</hi> increaſed in Trade and
Wealth, ſo the rigour of theſe Laws ſlackned; not that it was beſt they
should do ſo, but indulged as a more tolerable evil, which the Realm was
better a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble to bear; yet to this day the middle ſort of people in
<hi>England</hi> are much more modeſt and ſparing<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61834:60"/>than
thoſe of the ſame Rank in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now whether it may not be convenient ſo far to revive
Sumptuary Laws, as may give ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint to the great Extravagances of
this National Conſumption, that ſo threatens the Impoverish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this
Kingdom, is worth the Governments Conſideration: And when <hi>Ireland</hi>
arrives to the ſame ſtate of Trade and Wealth of <hi>England,</hi> then
theſe Enormities will be more tolerable; but as the caſe now ſtands, the
ſame Reaſon that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Anceſtors herein ought to bear ſway with
us.</p>
                     <p>But this Extravagancy in Garb is not only thus ruinous and
deſtructive to the Wealth of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but alſo is accompanied with
many other intolerable Inconveniences.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The moſt God-provoking Sin of Pride, for which
the moſt dreadful Judgments of God hath laid waſte and ruined Nations, as
<hi>Eſay</hi> 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is manifeſted by this Immoderateneſs in
Garb.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This Extravagancy of the meaner ſort provokes
the Nobility and Gentry to that height of Exceſs herein, to the weakning of
their Eſtates, that the ſame Patrimony their Anceſtors lived plentifully
on, kept noble Houſes, did many good Works, and yet increaſed their
Eſtates, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out raking their Tennants, they cannot live on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out running
greatly into Debt, ſome of them till Tradeſmen will truſt them no more;
and all to keep themſelves diſtinguished from their Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It ingenders Emulation, or rather Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, 
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61834:60"/>in the minds of thoſe of higher Degree againſt the
meaner ſort; when they obſerve they cannot put themſelves into any Garbe
or Mode, but they will be in it, nay out do the graveſt of them.
<hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> tells us of Sir <hi>John Collthrop,</hi> a <hi>Norfolk</hi>
Knight in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. ſent to his Taylor at
<hi>Norwich</hi> as much Cloth of the Mode-colour as would make him a Garment,
which a Shoomaker ſeeing, imployed the Taylor to buy him of the ſame; which
ſo vext the Knight, that he cauſed the Taylor to pink his Garment full of
Holes, which cured the Shoomaker of his proud Humour; he vowed never to be of
the Gentlemans Fashion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. But let the Knight now change his Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on once
a month, the Shoomaker will vie with him, if all the Shooes in his Shop will
pay for it.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It abates and wears off that due Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and
Reſpect Inferiours owe to Superiours; for my Gaffer thinks himſelf as good
a man as my Lord, when he obſerves himſelf as fine; and where neither of
them are known, shall contract as much Obſervation and Reſpect.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, This unlimited Extravagancy of the meaner ſort is
the chief cauſe of our intolerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of Foreign Manufacture: for
the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Gentry are not the twentieth part of the number that
conſume our Foreign Silks and Modes; and their Conſumption would not be
felt by the Nation, if the other were reſtrained, and injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to wear our
own Manufacture, it would treble the damage by imploying our own poor, and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61834:61"/>the Growth of the Country, which would inrich
the Tennant, and proportionably raiſe the Rents and value of Land.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, It neceſſarily raiſeth the Wages of all
Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, Labourers, and Servants; for they may better afford to work for two
thirds of their wages, and live better of it, if it were not for the
exceſſive increaſe of the Charge of their Families, by this vanity of
living higher and being finer. And this increaſe of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges is the greateſt
Tax on the Nation, though the receiver is made no richer, only ſprucer and
lazyer.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, This ſpruce Garb of both Sexes, eſpecially
the Female, is the greateſt inticement to thoſe filthy Luſts of the Flesh
this age wallows in; as that Debauching Cuſtom of <hi>Healthing</hi> is the
great provoker to the ſwinish ſin of Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo this
ſpruceneſs of Garb and Apparel is the great allurement to thoſe
abominable Adulteries, ſo shameleſsly practiced amongſt us. For when the
Debauches of a place obſerve mean mens Wives and Daughters adorned above the
Ranks and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of their Parents or Husbands, they fancy they are
deſigned for Invitations to incourage them to attaque their Chaſtity, and
find themſelves not always miſtaken. That it would be ſeaſonable to
revive that Law or Cuſtom in uſe amongſt the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that all
perſons convict, or notoriouſly f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

when he ſaw her in the Attire of an Harlot, to be one. And in the 
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61834:61"/>year 1353. <hi>the Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>on the
Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Mayor and City of</hi> London, <hi>paſt an Act that no
infamous Woman should wear any Hoods, or other Attire upon her Head, but

heard me complain of the waſtful and ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Bravery of Women, and as
often have you heard me inveigh againſt the laviſh ſpending of men, not
only private perſons but Magiſtrates alſo, and how this City of ours is
ſick of two contrary Diſeaſes, to wit, pinching Avarice, and
ſuperfluous Prodigality; two Plagues, I ſay, that have been the bane and

                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:61834:62"/>&amp;c. <hi>To conclude, ſaith he, my opinion is, that at

His humour differed from a modern perſon, of no mean Character, who ſwore
it did not become a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to pay his Debts: To whom I may reply, He that

                     <p>I do not cite theſe Examples, as if I eſteemed rich and
ſumptuous Apparel unſeemly for Princes and Nobles, both Morality and
Divinity allows, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Solemnities; but to shew how far the moſt
heroick noble minds have ſlited, and raiſed their ſpirits above it. And
doubtleſs the more, leaſt their examples should provoke their Subjects to
exceſs, who are more apt to imitate their Princes vices than their virtues.
And doubtleſs it is the intereſt of Princes to reſtrain their Subjects
from ſuch enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities as effeminates their ſpirits, and unſits them for
warlike hardships and actions, or whereby they conſume and weaken their
Eſtates, which diſables them from contributing thoſe aids the ſafety of

                     <p>I could demonſtrate, if his Majeſty's Subjects of this
Kingdom would but contribute what they vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſume in rioting and
exceſs, it would amount to more than all the eſtablisht Revenue; but were 
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61834:63"/>the third part of their voluntary unneceſſary
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption taxed on them by their Prince, they would groan under it, as an

Virtue, that the Noble Women threw away their golden Girdles, the Emblems of

the midſt of a potent people that know they may not only innocently but
meritoriouſly break their Faith with all Hereticks, as they eſteem all
Proteſtants.</p>
                        <p>Now this is obſervable, that Perjuries are no where
frequent where prophane Oaths are not common; for when the later, through
cuſtom, hath ſtupified the Conſcience, that the prophaning and
blaſpheming the ſacred Name of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a paſs-time, it wears off
that natural aw and dread of God, by familiariſing the Name of 
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61834:68"/>God vainly makes it eaſie to invoke his Name falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
the Solemnity of a Court will not deter them from Perjury to their Neighbours
harm, when the dread of Gods great Tribunal will not aw them from wronging
their own Souls.</p>
                        <p>Therefore whilſt prophane Swearing paſſeth for a

                        <p>And I eſtimate the damage this Nation ſuſtains by

                        <p>For as it in it ſelf a God-provoking ſin, ſo is it

for other Sins, as on <hi>Babylon, Iſaiah</hi> 63.6. on <hi>Moab

their Health; many perſons, and thoſe no mean ones, have found it a ſhort
journey from the Tavern to the Grave, who might have lived many years eminently
uſeful to their King and Country.</p>
                        <p>And if any ſhould take the pains, out of venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to

                        <p>The ſecond Expedient to reſtrain this national ruining
Vice, is, for all perſons of Quality, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Magiſtrates, to
endeavour to bring it into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by their perſonall examples, as an
Humour below their Quality, and a Practice inconſiſtent with their Duty to
God, to whom they muſt all give an account of their Stewardſhips; and their
Allegiance to their King, whoſe Laws require them to ſuppreſs all Vice,
and particularly Healthing, by Proclamation, well obſerving that this Vice
can never be reſtrain'd, whilſt that enticing, enſnaring cuſtom of
Healthing is in ſuch credit, not only in Taverns, but at Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
Tables, whereby oft times temperate and ſober perſons are in a ſort
trepann'd into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, to the hazard of their Health, being unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
thereto: For this ſnare obligeth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons on their civility to their
Friend, or perſons of Honor, to pledge their Healths; and having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
two or three Glaſſes, as much as their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution will bear without
harm, it will be reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a diſreſpect to others ſucceeding, to
refuſe; nay, ſometimes their Loyalty is at ſtake, when the 
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61834:78"/>Kings Health comes after ſeveral others, if they find
themſelves indiſpoſed to drink it now, though the difference between the
form of words remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſuch a perſon, or a good Health to him may little

                        <p n="1">1. In the frequency and commoneſs of it, not only

                        <p>The Indignation Heathens have had againſt this Vice,

                        <hi>When I was at</hi> Worms (ſaid <hi>Luther</hi>)
<hi>the Biſhop of</hi> Magdeburgh <hi>came unto me, and ſaid, I know we
have an evil Cauſe in hand, and that your Doctrine is right: yet for ſome
reaſons beſt known to our ſelves, we neither may nor will receive it. In
like manner the Cardinal of</hi> Saltsburgh <hi>ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, we know, and
it is written in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, that Prieſts juſtly might marry, and
that Matrimony is far better than the ſhameleſs and wicked Whoring which
Prieſts drive and uſe; yet notwithſtanding (ſaid he) we muſt neither
alter nor reform it; for the Emperor will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> Germany <hi>to be
diſturbed for the Conſcience ſake.</hi> Luth. Colloq. 325.</p>
                     <p>In the Council of <hi>Lateran, ann. Dom.</hi> 1515. they
firſt concluded the Article of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, though the Pope had been
infallible long before; and then alſo decreed, that a Cardinal might lawfully
keep but five Whores and Youths to be his Chamberlains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But
they had his Holineſſes ſtores of his tolerated Stews to ſupply their
wants: beſides his vaſt treaſure of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences to pardon theſe venial

                     <p>Thus you have the Riſe and Growth of Error and
Prophaneneſs how they gained ground againſt Truth and Piety ſtep by
ſtep, by a perſon that lived in an age of Diſcovery, and made it his
buſineſs to detect their Errors and Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>Now from this polluted Fountain hath flowed all the
Debauchery of Chriſtendom; and ſince the reformed Churches have ſo
tenaciouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted about the true Forms, many of them have loſt the
true power and holy Life of Religion, and degenerated into <hi>Romes</hi>
Prophaneneſs; and doubtleſs will lick up their Errors and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions,
rather than part with their Luſts, when they come in competition; for when

much ſtruggle for the truth of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nityes.</p>
                     <p>And no Hiſtory, ſacred or civil, gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of

                     <p>Sometimes Banks are erected from the plenty of Money, in
places not capable of Trade, or where perſons are not willing to adventure in
Trade, and<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61834:104"/>ſo employ their Money at Uſury, or Exchange,
to foreign places, as <hi>Genoa, Placentia,</hi> and moſt of the Banks in
<hi>Italy,</hi> which are the greateſt and ancienteſt Banks in the World:
<hi>Heylin</hi> obſerves the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was indebted to the Bank
of <hi>Genoa,</hi> a Tun and a half of Gold at one time, and eighteen millions

<hi>Irelands,</hi> I shall only inſiſt upon Banks, for the ſupply of the
want of Money, which may properly be called a Land, or dry Bank, yet not wholly
without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; but like ſome Merchants, who with a ſmall Stock, and large
Credit, will drive a great Trade.</p>
                     <p>This ſort of <hi>Bank</hi> muſt be founded upon
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted viſible Credit, that all perſons who have Money to ſpare, may
covet to lodge it there, rather than in any other place, having the knowledge
of the <hi>Solvent Capital</hi> for their ſecurity; and the great Credit upon
which the whole ſucceſs of their Bank depends, it being with them as with
ſome Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants that are not ſo much concerned, to have twenty Bonds ſued
as one Bill of Exchange pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted.</p>
                     <p>From whence it is, the Rich in <hi>Holland</hi> are as glad

they will ſoon be diſcerned, and there can be no<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61834:105"/>collateral Incumbrance on that Security; this will be a Security to a
Bank of 4000 Pounds <hi>per. ann.</hi> Lands, being worth twelve years
purchaſe, within ten miles of the City, which will raiſe a Bank-Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity

                     <p>And that no place or perſon might be depriv'd of the

Branches or Members of the <hi>Principal Bank,</hi> and take into their Company
the neer adjacent places, and to hold a weekly correſpondence with each
other, and credit each others Bills, or Bank-tickets. Nor will ſuch Banks
reſtrain, or confine any man from the freedom of Trade; for though none have
the benefit of the Bank-credit, that hath not a Bank-ſecurity, yet shall they
have liberty, if they deſire it, to trade in Company with the Bankers, and
have equal profit with them, proportionably to their reſpective Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures;
and at the end of every voyage, liberty to withdraw or continue their Stocks,
as they shall ſee cauſe, and chuſe the place they will adventure unto,
and the Commodities they will export, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, or elſe left to trade by

knowledge in Trade, or ſcruple Uſury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may imploy their
Stocks, be they great or ſmall, upon equal terms, with the Bankers, allowing
only for Factorage, or proviſion towards the maintenance of the charge: And

Manufactures of the Countrey will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, for we neither want Materials, nor
Artiſts, only Markets, which will be the main buſineſs of this
<hi>Bank</hi> to contrive; and having Shipping and Stock of their own, their
Intereſt will prompt them unto it, ſince they can neither traffick into the
<hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> nor <hi>Baltick</hi>-Seas, the two chief places for the
Merchants of <hi>Ireland</hi> to inlarge their Trade unto, without woollen and
worſted Manufacture, which now when made, cannot be diſpoſed.</p>
                     <p>The abuſes in our woollen and worſted Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, by
which their value and credit is impaired, will be rectified; for they will not
buy a piece but<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61834:109"/>what is ſearched, and tried by perſons
of their own appointment, and place their own Seales as well as the Makers,
upon every piece, which will bring our Manufacturies into credit in foreign
Markets; and the like they will do for Leather, Butter, Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, Flesh, Fish,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> the want of which is the ruine of the foreign Trade of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> which is now under ſo ill repute beyond Sea, that
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Goods, and Nought, are terms convertible.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, in whatſoever they shall obſerve the
Artiſts of <hi>Ireland</hi> defective, they can eaſily procure a ſupply,
which will alſo put life into the Ingenious, and Induſtrious, when they can

                     <p>Beſides, theſe <hi>Banks</hi> are the only means to
reſcue our Trade out of the Hands of Foreigners, and will wear out foreign
Stocks, by which the greateſt part of our foreign Traffick is now driven, to
the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching foreign Merchants, and beggering of our own: Foreigners having
Money at low Intereſt, and gaining by their Exchange, they are able to
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſell us in foreign Parts; ſo that our Merchants chooſe rather to be
their Factors, than trade with their own Stocks; which is the reaſon we have
ſo few wealthy Merchants, and thoſe we have, after they have gained
Eſtates by Trade, inſtead of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing their Traffick, purchaſe

perſons, that this <hi>Bank</hi>-credit of paying or receiving Money will be
as ready, and as ſafe as the ordinary way of paying and receiving Money in
<hi>Specia,</hi> ſince with much caſe theſe Bills may be transferred from
one perſon to another; and the trouble and labour of telling, weighing, and
judging of the goodneſs or badneſs of Coins, and danger of miſcounting
hereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
                     <p>In order whereunto, every perſon that either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives or
pays Money in <hi>Bank,</hi> hath his account in the <hi>Bank-book,</hi> and at
the deſire of the Creditor, his Stock in <hi>Bank,</hi> either in part, or in
whole, is transferred to the account of ſuch other perſons as himſelf
shall aſſign. As for example; A Clothier ſells unto a Merchant or Draper
an 100<hi>
                           <abbr>l.</abbr>
                        </hi> worth of Cloth, the buyer having Credit in
<hi>Bank,</hi> aſſigns 100<hi>
                           <abbr>l.</abbr>
                        </hi> to the Seller; the
Book-keeper makes the Merchant Debtor, and gives the Clothier credit for ſo
much again. The Clothier being indebted in whole, or in part of the ſaid
ſum to the Woollman, the Clothier is made Debtor, and the Woollman Creditor:
The Woollman being a Farmer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> owes the like ſum to his
Landlord for Rent, the Woollman is made Debtor, and his Landlord Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor; the
Landlord is indebted, or hath occaſion to buy Goods in Town; the Landlord is
made Debtor, and the ſaid perſon is Creditor. If the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom the
Landlord was indebted be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailers, that have occaſion to buy Goods of the
Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant that firſt aſſigned in <hi>Bank,</hi> the Retailers have Goods,
and the Account cleared without receiving<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61834:110"/>or paying a peny
of Money. The which is alſo pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable in moſt other caſes, and all
theſe Aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have the ſecurity of a <hi>Bond</hi> of the Staple,
whereby not only the hazard and trouble of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, (as before) but the hazard
of diſappointment, and the charge and delay of Law-ſuits is wholly
prevented, and this is not only as to intire ſums, but the
100<hi>
                           <abbr>l.</abbr>
                        </hi> may be as eaſily asſigned to 20 perſons with
a little more trouble in writing, and will not only be uſeful in this caſe
of Traffick, and prevent the hazard and charge many Merchants now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, by
the ignorance or unfaithfulneſs of their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheers, but alſo accommodate
other perſons that have occaſion to pay or receive Money.</p>
                     <p>As for example; A Gentleman having an Eſtate in ſeveral
parts of the Kingdom, far diſtant from his dwelling, may order his Rents to
be paid in the next adjacent <hi>Bank;</hi> and being there lodged, he may
tranſmit it to any other Bank in the Kingdom, and thou aſſign a Debtor or
other perſon to receive it: And this ſort of payment being all viſible in
<hi>Bank,</hi> will be a more certain Diſcharge or Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance than any
other that can be given, and will wear all other Specialties much out of uſe,
and prompt all men to chooſe Bank-Security before any other, where he may
have his Money on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate at any time, before it's due.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, this <hi>Bank</hi>-credit will be a conveniency,
and great incouragement to young Merchants, who may be both ingenious, and
induſtrious; yet their ſmall Stocks being lodged in Goods, which they
cannot diſpoſe, by reaſon the Market is cloyed, or<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61834:111"/>other accidents; whereas upon the ſecurity of theſe Goods, they
may have Credit in <hi>Bank</hi> to keep up their Trade, and pay off ſuch
Debts out of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of ſuch Goods, as they can diſpoſe of them to
their beſt advantage.</p>
                     <p>Or, ſuppoſe a Clothier, Tanner, or Chandler,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> have disburſt their Stocks, in providing Cloath, Leather, or
Tallow, and Markets fail at the ſeaſon expected; the charge of
Ware-Houſes, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> lye upon them, though they have
no free Stock to keep them at work, are thereby eaten up; but if they have this
<hi>Bank</hi> to come unto, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the quantity of their
Commodities, they are ſupplyed with Money, or Credit, to go on chearfully in
their Callings.</p>
                     <p>Or it may happen, an honeſt and ſufficient Man may be
indebted upon a Statute or Judgment, and cannot raiſe the Money by the time
limited, nor the Creditors occaſions for his Money ſuffer him to forbear
it, the Credit of one is preſerved, and the Want of the other ſupplyed,
without extremity of charge, and damage to either; ſince the <hi>Bank,</hi>
up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Security, anſwers the Money.</p>
                     <p>And beſides the general benefit to the Kingdom by
increaſing Trade and Commerce, there will not be a perſon of the higheſt,
or loweſt Rank, but will find a conveniency and benefit by the <hi>Bank.</hi>
A Nobleman of 10000<hi>
                           <abbr>l.</abbr> per ann.</hi> may have occaſion for

                        </hi> more or leſs, ſome short time before
his Rent come in; but without Mortgaging part of his Eſtate, and paying ſix
months Intereſt, no man will trouble himſelf to pay and receive 
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61834:111"/>Money, whereas if himſelf or any friend of his have
Credit in Bank he is ſupply'd for what weeks or days he pleaſes.</p>
                     <p>And ſo a poor man, ingenious and induſtrious, could put
himſelf into a way to maintain his Family comfortably, could he procure but a
ſmal Sum of Money; if he goes to Pawn-brokers, it is ordinary with them to
demand Six pence or Four pence a week for every Pound, which for a year is more
than the Principal; whereas by the Bank Lumber he may be ſupplied (if not
<hi>gratis,</hi> yet) at leſs than le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Intereſt; and by this the
<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves from Beggers; the
feebleſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, if not bed-rid, are put into a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to get
their livelihoods, and for others Hoſpitals are provided.</p>
                     <p>Therefore let not this Bank Traffique be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, as an
unpracticable notion; for it is beyond contradiction, that <hi>England,
&amp;c.</hi> have raiſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from little to great Trade thereby,
and ſo may <hi>Ireland,</hi> if not wanting to it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>This expedient of <hi>Banks and Company-trade</hi> were the
firſt foundation of the great Traffique of other Countries, flourishing in
Trade, as <hi>Venice, Florence, Belgia, &amp;c.</hi> where the very
Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Government are form'd principally for the promotion
of <hi>Trade,</hi> their Princes and Nobles being their chief Merchants, and
their Senates Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of Trade.</p>
                     <p>And the Hans-Towns of <hi>Germany</hi> raiſed their Trade
by this means, who were the firſt Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Trade we read of, above
ſixty Towns<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61834:112"/>and Cities united their Stocks and Policies,
of which <hi>Lubeck, Brumſwick, Danzick</hi> and <hi>Cullen</hi> were the
chief places of their Reſidence, and ſo great was their Trade and Credit
under that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, that all Princes granted them Priviledges, and they
kept their Courts by their Deputies, and Councils, at <hi>Bergen, Novagrade,
Antwerpe</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> where King <hi>Henry</hi> 3. granted them
great Priviledges, and the <hi>Still-yards</hi> for their reſidence, which
they enjoyed near 300 years; and managed their Trade by an Alderman and
Council, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Yeild of the Hans,</hi> ingroſſed
the Trade of <hi>England</hi> for Grain, Cables, Maſt, Pitch, Tar,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> until, by their example, each Country learnt the knowledge of
Trade themſelves, and diſmiſſed them.</p>
                     <p>And in the year 1551. being the 5. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. upon
complaint of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants, their priviledges were
ſeiſed into the <hi>Kings</hi> Hands, and the Trade ever ſince enjoyed by
the Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> to the great enriching of that famous
City.</p>
                     <p>And the beſt preſident I can lay before <hi>Ireland</hi>
is <hi>England,</hi> who untill the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. was as
confuſed, and conſequently as low in Trade, as <hi>Ireland</hi> is now, but
hath been eſpecially for theſe laſt 140 years, the moſt flourishing
Kingdom in Trade in the world; and they muſt commence the riſe and growth
of their Trade from their beginning to trade by <hi>united Stocks</hi> and
<hi>Policies,</hi> for which a Patent was firſt obtained by the Merchant
Staplers from <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. from which time we find our Statute 
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61834:112"/>Books crowded with excellent Laws for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging and
regulating Trade, which yet did not arrive to its height, and ſplendor, until
about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who did not only
confirm what was done by her Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, but augmented and greatly
enlarged the Priviledges of that <hi>ancient Company of Staplers,</hi> and
confirmed the Charter of the <hi>Muſcovy Company,</hi> newly granted by
<hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> and ordained in her time three new
Corporations for Trade, which enlarged the Trade of <hi>England</hi>
abundantly, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi> the <hi>Levant</hi> and
<hi>Eaſtland Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,</hi> the Priviledges of all which have been
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and enlarged, with great reſpect, by all her Succeſſors in
Parliament; and His Majeſty that now is hath added the <hi>African and
Canary</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies; that if we had no other Argument, to prove united
Stocks, and Policies in Trade, the great if not the only means to promote and
increaſe Traffique and Commerce, the Examples of ſo many prudent Princes
and States, and the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Parliaments</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> for this 300 years paſt might ſerve.</p>
                     <p>But I shall demonſtrate by good reaſon, and
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable authority, when oppoſed, that this one expedient shall
remove all the conſiderable impediments of Trade, in a short time, <hi>dam up
the current of much of our Expence upon Foreign Growth, ſhall reduce our
confuſed Trade to a method, improve the native Growth of the Country to its
height, as to Value at home, and Credit abroad, ſhall reſcue our Trade
managed by foreign Stocks into our own hands,<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61834:113"/>shall
increaſe His Majeſties Revenue, and enable his Subjects of</hi> Ireland
<hi>to farm it upon terms more to the Kings profit and conveniency, and the
King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms benefit and content, and to advance conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Sums upon the
Security of any Branch of His Majeſties Revenue, when his Affairs shall
require it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I will further undertake to demonſtrate, that all
other Expedients without this shall never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain theſe Ends; let a
Parliament paſs all the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of <hi>England</hi> for the incouragement
of Trade in <hi>Ireland,</hi> it shall ſignifie no more than good Laws
without Courts of Juſtice to execute them; for though Intereſt prompts
people to Induſtry, yet it neither qualifies nor governs them in right
me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to attain their ends: A ſtragling Trade ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by particular
perſons, each ſtriving to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his private Intereſt, though to the
ruine of the Trade in general, and obſtructing it in other particulars, can
no more make a Country flourish in Trade, than a ſtragling Army without
Diſcipline and Order can preſerve its peace.</p>
                     <p>But deſigning brevity, I shall only aſſert, that
<hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is now much more able to erect &amp; govern ſuch a Trade,
than <hi>England</hi> was about 300 years ago, when <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. incourag'd
it, and <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. eſtablished by Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Company of
<hi>Staplers,</hi> or <hi>Merchant Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers,</hi> which was the <hi>Mother
Company</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and all it enjoy'd until <hi>Philip</hi> and
<hi>Mary</hi> erected the <hi>Muſcovy Company</hi> yet that one
<hi>Company</hi> removed the <hi>Staple</hi> from foreign parts to our own
ports, and ſoon after the <hi>Clothing Trade</hi> from <hi>Flanders,</hi>
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Growth of <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially the Wools 
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61834:113"/>were improved to 5 and 7, and in ſome caſes (after the
Worſted-trade of Stuffs and Stockings was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained) to ten times its
value.</p>
                     <p>I am not unſenſible that this Work will meet with
oppoſition from ſome particular perſons, whoſe private Intereſt may
ſeem to be invaded by it; for ſo did that ancient and beneficial Company of
Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plers in <hi>England,</hi> as a Monopoly intrenching upon the Liberty of
the Subject, to the Parliaments in <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7.
<hi>Edw.</hi> 6. and Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, yet all parties being heard,
thoſe Complaints were quash'd, and the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the
<hi>Companies rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> and <hi>enlarged.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet again in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, the
impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the Clothiers prevailed againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany but after a
short tryal, the Clothing Countries were ruined, to that extremity, that in the
29th. of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Lords of the Council ſent for the members of
the Company, and deſired them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſume their Priviledges, and
cheerfully proceed in their Trade, and they should receive all poſſible
countenance and aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>So in the Reign of King <hi>James,</hi> Alderman
<hi>Cocken</hi> of <hi>London, &amp;c.</hi> prevailed to have the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
diſſolv'd, but after two years confuſion, Trade ſo miſerably
languished, that the King pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished his Proclamation, <hi>Anno</hi> 1617. for
the Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Company to its ancient Priviledges.</p>
                     <p>In like manner King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt obſerving
the decay of Trade, from the confuſion intruding Interlopers brought upon it,
publisht his Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Dec.</hi> 7. 1634. <hi>Whereas we have taken
into our <pb n="22" facs="tcp:61834:114"/>Princely conſideration, the manifold Benifits
that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to this Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and finding how much Government
and Order will conduce to the increaſe and advancement of the ſame, We have
thought fit, with the Advice of our Privy Council, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our Royal
Pleaſure herein,</hi> &amp;c. and then po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively and largely prohibits
any to intrude upon the Companies Priviledge, <hi>upon pain of his high
Diſpleaſure, and of ſuch Puniſhments as the Court of</hi> Star-Chamber,
<hi>whom We eſpecially charge with the Execution of our Royal Pleaſure
herein, ſhall think fit, to inflict, for ſuch Contempts.</hi> After this,
the 11th. of <hi>March</hi> 1643. both Houſes paſt an <hi>Ordinance,</hi>
intituled, <hi>For the Upholding of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Fellowſhip of
Merchant Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> near to the ſame
effect as His Majeſties Proclamation before recited.</p>
                     <p>And as Corporation Traffique hath procured all the
flourishing Trade <hi>England</hi> now enjoys, ſo the <hi>Portugals, Dutch,
&amp;c.</hi> have thereby altered the whole courſe of Trade that
<hi>Venice</hi> had with <hi>India, Arabia</hi> and <hi>Perſia; Venice,</hi>
being the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Mart for the Commodities of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, now buy of
us; ſo the <hi>English Levant</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany hath wreſted the <hi>India</hi>
Trade from the <hi>Turks,</hi> and now ſell where <hi>Venice</hi> uſed to
buy. And that which gives <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> the advantage
in Traffique is, the ſtaple Commodities they ſell ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Life;
as Flesh, Fish, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Belly, Cloth, Stuffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
for the Back; that in moſt Countries <hi>England</hi> trades with, they wear
<hi>Englands</hi> Woollen Livery, eat in <hi>English</hi> Pewter, Seaſons 
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61834:114"/>and Sauce with <hi>Englands Indian</hi> Spices, shod with
<hi>English</hi> Leather; there is no Clothing in <hi>Spain</hi> eſteemed
like the <hi>English</hi> Bayſe and Stuffs, nor no Food exceeds the
<hi>English</hi> Herring and Pilcher: <hi>Sweden, Denmark,</hi> and all thoſe
cold Northeaſt Countries within the <hi>Sound,</hi> to the bottom of the
<hi>Baltick,</hi> keep themſelves warm by <hi>English</hi> woollen Cloth; and
all this obtained by vertue of <hi>Englands</hi> Trade by united Stoks and
Policy. For in little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 100 years <hi>Europe</hi> was ſo far from
trading with the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> the
<hi>Weſt</hi> were unheard of, as I shew in my Treatiſe of Traffique; and
the <hi>Eaſt</hi> unknown otherwiſe than by report to our Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and
Merchants: <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Merchants were eſteemed
great Adventurers, until the <hi>Turkie</hi> and <hi>Eaſt India</hi>
Companies were incorporated by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who God made
inſtrumental, not only to reform Religion, but to regulate and advance Trade:
<hi>Englands</hi> and <hi>Hollands</hi> true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and potent Trade came
together, God grant they never go together, it is worthy our obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
how the mighty flourishing Monarchy of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſince <hi>Charles</hi>
the 5. and his Son <hi>Philip</hi> the 2. hath dwindled away, and decayed in
Fame and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency ſince they erected their barbarous Inquiſition, which
banished their Trade and Wealth to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> that
<hi>Antwerpe</hi> and <hi>Sevils</hi> Ebb tide in Trade hath made it full Sea
at <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;</hi> and as <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Holland</hi> hath gained their Trade and Wealth by being Receptacles and
Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of perſecuted Proteſtants; ſo will the contrary loſe it: the
<hi>Italians</hi> have a proverb, <hi>He that would<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61834:115"/>improve</hi> Italy <hi>muſt deſtroy</hi> Milan, that is,
diſperſe the multitude of Artiſts there ſetled to the other Cities that
want them, which nothing ſo naturally effects, as Perſecution. Let them
beware they loſe it not by perſecuting them, and driving them away. The
vaſt Trade <hi>Spain</hi> had ingroſſed both in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and
<hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> and in <hi>Africa</hi> they might yet have enjoyed, had
not cruel <hi>de Alva,</hi> by his inhumane ſeverities, forced the
<hi>Dutch</hi> to caſt off the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> iron Yoke, and defend their
Liberties; whereby, as Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> obſerves, by the great
multitudes of people crowded together in a narrow compaſs of Land, they were
neceſſitated to improve their Induſtry at Sea; and after the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Fortugals,</hi> who were then the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of
<hi>Spain,</hi> had entirely enjoyed the enriching Trade of the <hi>Eaſt
Indies, &amp;c.</hi> as before, for almoſt one hundred years, <hi>viz.</hi>
from <hi>Anno</hi> 1498. until 1595. the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſent a Fleet from

Ships, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Aſſention,</hi> the <hi>Dragon,</hi> the
<hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Suſan,</hi> under the Command of Captain
<hi>Lancaſter,</hi> ſince which, by the prudent Government of that
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, hath equalized the <hi>Portuguies</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> having

                     </p>
                     <p>I do but hint theſe things here to evidence the undoubted
advantage of Company Trade, inſiſting largely upon them in my Treatiſe of
Traffique, in the Chapter of Diſcoveries of new Trades.</p>
                     <p>And that this way of Corporation-Trade has not only greatly
enlarged Trade, but enriched the places of its Reſidence, we have manifold
inſtances; the ancient Company of Merchant-Adventurers, now called the
<hi>Hamborough</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, erected by <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, in 1296.
was courted by the Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> to make their Reſidence at
<hi>Antwerpe,</hi> where they firſt ſettled the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Staple,
and had granted to them great Priviledges, and made the City flourish in Trade;
which being obſerved by that inſpectious Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the third,
he, to bring the Trade to his own Ports, prohibited the Tranſportation of
Wools, and granted great encouragement to <hi>Dutch</hi> Weavers to ſet up
their Craft in <hi>England,</hi> and ſoon after prohibited all foreign Cloth
from being tranſported into the Realm, confirmed by <hi>Edward</hi> the
Fourth, who ſettled their Priviledges by Charter in the year 1406. which hath
been confirmed and enlarged by all his Succeſſors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:61834:116"/>Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for the
better vending their Cloths, when their Quantity exceeded home Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, gave
them power under the Great Seal to treat with foreign Princes and States for
places to ſettle the Reſidence of their Factors, and Stores; upon which all
the Princes and States in <hi>Flanders, Holland</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi>
ſtrove who should enjoy them; and whereſoever they removed, they drew a
vaſt Trade after them: their preſent Reſidence is at <hi>Dortrech</hi>
for the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and <hi>Hamborough</hi> for <hi>Germany,</hi>
where the chief Court of their Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship now reſides: they tranſport all
ſorts of Cloths dreſſed and dyed, Lead, Tin, Oyl, Stockens, Hats,
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fruits, and Wines; and make their returns in Linnings,
<hi>Rhenish</hi> Wines, Mather, Hops, Sope, Wire, Copper, Braſs, Iron, Steel,
Quick-ſilver, Gunpowder, Flax, Hemp, Allom, Wax, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This
Company hath power, by their Charter, yearly to elect a Governour, Deputy
Governour, and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and to ſettle their Reſidents &amp;
Courts in any parts beyond Sea, and ſeveral places in <hi>England,</hi> as
<hi>London York, Hull, Newcaſtle,</hi> &amp;c. with power of making Acts and
Ordinances (ſo as they are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Law of <hi>England</hi>) for
the better Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of their Trade, likewiſe power to hear and decide
Cauſes, to implead, ſine and punish Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors.</p>
                     <p>This grew to be the moſt flourishing Company for Trade in
the world, until <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the
<hi>Muſcovy</hi> Company, which ſoon wreſted a great part of their Trade
from them, which were at firſt called the Corporation for Diſcovery of new 
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61834:116"/>Trades, (a Deſign that would well ſute with the
preſent ſtate of <hi>Ireland</hi>) whoſe great Priviledges were confirmed
and enlarged, as before, by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> much after the method of
the other, and their Trade much the ſame: and after this ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Princeſs, for the Improvement of the Trade and Wealth of her Country, added
to theſe, she found the three other Companies beforementioned, <hi>viz.</hi>
the <hi>Levant</hi> or <hi>Turkie</hi> Company, which made the firſt
Diſcovery of that vaſt Trade, ſince driven in the Signorie of
<hi>Venice,</hi> and the Dominions of the <hi>Grand Seignior;</hi> and thereby
oſerved the vaſt Trade betwixt <hi>Aleppo</hi> and other <hi>Levant</hi>
Ports with the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> managed by Land carriage, which
encouraged them to enquire into a more cheap and gainful way to obtain
<hi>Eaſt India</hi> Commodities, at firſt Hand.</p>
                     <p>And that produc'd that moſt famous Country-inriching
Company, called the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who obtain'd a Charter for
great Priviledges from the Queen, and hath managed their Trade by a joint
Stock, reported to be 600000<hi>
                           <abbr>l.</abbr>
                        </hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they have built
and maintained a gallnt Fleet of ſtately Ships for War as well as Burthen,
imployed multitudes of people in their Plantations, Ships and Factories, to the
great Honour and Wealth of their Country.</p>
                     <p>And after this, in the 21. year of the Reign of that moſt
famous Queen, that is, in the year 1579. did she incorporate the
<hi>Eaſtland</hi> Company, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow them with great Priviledges and
Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to trade in <hi>Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Pruſia</hi> 
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:61834:117"/>and <hi>Pomerland,</hi> from the River <hi>Odera</hi>
Eaſtward.</p>
                     <p>And it is worth obſerving how ſmall beginnings in Trade
beget great increaſe; Trade, like that Grain of Muſtard-ſeed our Saviour
ſpeaks of, being caſt into the ground, grows up to a great tree, that the
Fowls of the air may lodge in the Branches of it; and it is alſo
obſervable, if foreign Traffique did live, yet it never flourished in this
part of the world, until it was managed by united Stocks and Policies, as in
the forementioned inſtances in our own Country, beſides what is of the
ſame kind amongſt all our Neighbours flourishing in Trade.</p>
                     <p>And as in theſe many examples from paſt times evidence
that they eſteemed this way of Traffique the only way to increaſe Trade,
ſo is their Wiſdom approv'd and confirm'd by the prudent in this age, His
Majeſty that now is hath ſet to his Seal, that Corporation-trade is the
ſtrength of foreign Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique, by his not only confirming what his Royal
Predeceſſors before did, but alſo by his adding the <hi>African</hi> and
<hi>Canary</hi> Companies; the firſt not only endowed with priviledge, that
ſounds like Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prerogatives; as power of Peace and War, raiſing
Forts, building and equipping Ships of War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to appoint
Governors, to conſtitute Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and dignified with the title
of the <hi>Royal Company;</hi> and well they may, when <hi>His Royal
Highneſs</hi> hath bore Office, and the chief Princes and Nobles of
<hi>England</hi> enrolled Members, as Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Buckingham,</hi> Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> Earl of <hi>Peterbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, St.
Albans, Sandwich, Bath, Arlington, Shaſts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, &amp;c.</hi> and the
Teritories of this Royal Company<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61834:117"/>is from <hi>Sally</hi> in
<hi>South Barbary</hi> to <hi>Cape de Bona Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peranza,</hi> a Princely
Dominion. And having thus briefly hinted, how the Wiſdom and Experience of
paſt ages, and many Nations have ſet to their Seals, to the rationality
&amp; peculiar advantage to this way of improving Trade by united Stocks &amp;
Policies. I shall hint ſome inconveniencies attending its omiſſion.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the want of ſettled Correſpondency for want of
Intelligence is the ruine of Trade; for when men grope out a Trade, as blind
folk do their way, they ſtumble at many a ſtone, and run their heads
againſt many poſts which light would prevent.</p>
                     <p>And few ſingle perſons, at leaſt in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
are able to carry on ſuch a Trade as will maintain Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, or Factors, to
inform them how the Rates of Goods rule at the ſeveral parts they trade with,
but muſt depend upon the Advice of ſuch perſons upon the place, whoſe
Intereſt it is to encourage their Principles to confine to them, let Goods
turn to Profit or Loſs, they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct their Proviſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which contracts much perplexity and confuſion in Trade; whereas Trade in
Company, managed with united Stocks, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents them, being able to bear the
charge of able Factors in the Country they trade unto; and able to bear a
conſiderable loſs, which would ruine a particular perſon, able to keep
their Goods when Markets are low, till they riſe, able to ingroſs the Bulk
of a Commodity when brought low by unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed clogging of Markets, and
thereby raiſe Rates; for by their well governed Correſpondency they are
inform'd not only what Rates Goods go at,<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61834:118"/>but what quantity
of them are in the Stores, at each foreign port, and what time they will
probably take for conſumption, what kind of Vintage or Crops is in the
Countries producing them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by theſe views can
diſcourage their increaſe at home, until their Markets mend abroad, that
they may make their Commodities pay Intereſt for their ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and without
theſe and the like expedients, no man can ſecure a Trade to turn to any
certain Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; but as a meer Lottery, ſome Voyage brings a prize, and
ſome a blank; whereby men of ſmall Stocks are oft times undone, and the
beſt perplex'd and diſcouraged.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This Trade in Company with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
united Stock, will preſerve a Trade from ruine by Interlopers, that will be
nibling at Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique they underſtand not; as Pedlars at Land, ſo theſe
at Sea, perplex and ruine the Trade of skilful able Merchant, sand do
themſelves no good: for, as Pedlers may underſell the ableſt Shopkeepers
in ſome ſmall Wares, by living after a beggerly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant way, paying no
Rents, nor bearing no charge in their Country, and maintaining themſelves by
conditioning where they ſell ſmall Markets to have Victuals,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> into the bargain; ſo theſe Sea-ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers much after the
ſame manner maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and thereby are able to underſell the
Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, who have great Families to maintain at home, beſides chargeable
Factors abroad, great Duties to pay to the King, chargeable Offices to bear in
their Cities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if the Merchants shall have no more
priviledge from the State than the<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61834:118"/>Interloper, he will be
diſcouraged, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Trade of the Country ruined from
theſe and the like inconveniencies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which I have obſerved
to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Trade of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the ſmall Trade I have driven
there my ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the Trade of Wools, one of the chief Commodities
of the Country, greatly damnified, their Wools ſometimes vended at half their
value, near to the undoing of the Sheep-maſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Proceeding principally from the abuſe of Trade by
Interlopers: for, although Wools muſt riſe and fall with the Manufactures
of <hi>England,</hi> where they are chiefly vended, yet as the principle
Clothiers of <hi>England</hi> will ſtore up their Cloths and Stuffs when
Markets fail, until they can ſell them to profit; ſo should the principle
Sheep-maſters reſerve their Wools, and the Wool-Merchants ſtore up poor
mens ſmall parcels until Trade mend, and then not tumble over great
quantities, to clog and lower Markets; but to feed Markets as they obſerve
their Trade requires; by which means the Wools of <hi>Ireland</hi> were kept up
to a competent Rate for 7 years together by my ſelf, as both the
Sheep-maſters and Skinners in the Province of <hi>Leinſter</hi> and
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naght</hi> have often owned to me.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. So for Tallow, and Butter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> trading
in them becomes a Lottery from the ſame cauſe, as my ſelf experienced
ſeveral times, and perticularly in the year 1670. having occaſion to buy a
conſiderable quanty, I agreed for ſeveral Tuns at 24. and it fell, I bought
more at 23. it ſtill fell, to 22. and in ſome parts of the Kingdom 21. I
marvelled at it, my<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61834:119"/>Intelligence giving no advice that any
great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities were in the Merchants hands, either at <hi>London</hi> or in
foreign Markets, but bore a competent rate, only low in the Weſt of
<hi>England;</hi> I ſuſpected it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceeded from our Blind man buff
Merchants cloging the Market; I ſtopt shiping my own, and preſently bought
up all I could in <hi>Dublin</hi> at price current, and writ to my
Correſpondents and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in all parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to do the
ſame upon my account; upon which the Price preſently ſtarted, and riſe
to 24 and 25. and ſo held it that ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>By which Experience in theſe and ſeveral other
Commodities, I obſerved the Trade of <hi>Ireland</hi> was ruined by
diſorder; and was preſervable, and capable of Improvement, if rightly
managed by conſiderable Stocks, either in ſingle hands, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the
prudence of an experienced Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, or in Company, by a prudent Governor and
Court of Aſſiſtance, according to the paterns of the aforementioned
Companies of <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. This is the only Expedient to reſcue the
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of our Trade out of the hands of foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, at whoſe mercy we
are, whether we shall have a high or a low Rate for our Native commodities; for
they that command the largeſt Capital, or Stock of a Kingdom or State, will
rule and govern the Trade of it, and ſet the Rates on all Commodities
exported or imported.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object. Englands</hi> Trade is divided into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
which you have named, as <hi>Hamborough, Muſcovy, Levant, Eaſt India,
&amp;c.</hi> and would you<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61834:119"/>propoſe all the Trade of
<hi>Ireland</hi> to be contained in the circuit of one Company?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though the great Trade of <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Holland, &amp;c.</hi> may well bear and fully imploy ſeveral
Companies with joint ſtock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the Trade of
<hi>Ireland</hi> will not; <hi>England</hi> began with one Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for
Trade in <hi>Edw.</hi> the thirds time, and ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted no more until
<hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> who granted their Patent for the
<hi>Muſcovy</hi> Company, which was upwards of 200 years: for Trades as well
as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures may be overſtock'd, and thereby ſtarved; for no Trade
thrives where the Merchant grows not rich, as well as the Country benefited,
and as the beſt of Trades may be made bad by too many of the ſame Faculty
in one City; ſo the beſt expedient for Foreign traffique may be rendred
unſucceſsful by erecting more Corporations than the commerce of the Country
will bear: for Traffique like Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter runs with the deepeſt and ſtrongeſt
current, when it is by banks reduc'd to a narrower channel; and when it begins
with <hi>Nilus</hi> to overflow its banks it is time enough to increaſe its
channels; as I shew in the Chapter of the Progreſs of Trade: and from hence
it was, after <hi>London</hi> began to gain a further inſpection into Foreign
traffique, they grew ſo ſoon weary of the Yeild of the <hi>Hance,</hi>
which from the time of our <hi>Henr.</hi> 3. to <hi>Philip</hi> and
<hi>Mary</hi> were not only permitted, but courted and encouraged in their
Commerce with us, enjoying great Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and paying ſmall Duties; from
which time their Cuſtoms were enhanced from one to twenty <hi>per Cent.</hi>
the <hi>Hance</hi> not only complain'd, but clamour'd<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61834:120"/>aloud, for breach of their ancient Priviledges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed unto them
by long preſcription, from thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſucceſſive Kings of
<hi>England,</hi> the which they pretended to have purchaſed with their
Money: King <hi>Philip</hi> undertook to accommodate the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but
Qeen <hi>Mary</hi> dying, and he retiring, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was effected; complaints
being afterwards made to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> she anſwered, that as she
would not innovate any thing, ſo she would protect them ſtill in the
immunities and condition she found them; hereupon their Navigation and
Traffique was ſuſpended a while, which proved very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants; for upon this they tryed what they could do
themſelves herein; and their Adventures and Returns proving ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
they took the whole Trade into their own hands.</p>
                     <p>This ſo nettled the <hi>Hance,</hi> that they deviſed
all the ways that a diſcontented people could to draw upon our
<hi>Staplers</hi> the ill opinion of other Nations and States; but that proving
of too ſmall a force to ſtop the current of ſo ſtrong a Trade as they
had got footing into, though they applied themſelves to the Emperor, as being
a Body incorporated to the Empire, and upon complaint obtained Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
to the Queen, to mediate the buſineſs, but they returned ſtill
<hi>re-inſecta:</hi> hereupon the Queen cauſed a Proclamation to be
published, that the Merchants of the <hi>Hance</hi> should be treated and
uſed as all other Strangers within her Dominions in point of Commerce,
without any mark of diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which they ſo ill reſented, they quit
the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61834:120"/>and ſo ended the Yeild of the
<hi>Hance,</hi> after 200 years flourishing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> Is there not a great hazard in this affair to
the principle Bankers in the miſmanagement of it, either for want of skill,
care or fidelity in its mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Officers? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is no humane affair but is ſubject
to injury; a Prince runs ſome hazard in the choice of his Counſellors, and
a State in the election of their Senators, and ſince there proceed no Angels
from <hi>Adam,</hi> the beſt of men will be ſubject to err.</p>
                     <p>But this conſtitution of Corporation-trade is as capable
of a ſolvant rational ſecurity, as is in the power of man to deviſe; and
to that height, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard nor read it ever failed any Undertakers theſe
400 years in <hi>England,</hi> or elſewhere; but on the contrary, as it hath
raiſed many Principalities and States, as is before obſerved, from poor and
low condition ro great wealth and potency, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular Families hath
it raiſed from low and mean, to worshipful and honourable Ranks; for the
method of managing this Society gives ſo clear and full an inſpection into
its conſtant ſtate, that each of its principle Creditors may inform
himſelf at pleaſure by the Comptrollers Books, whether its Capital decays
or increaſeth, and what profit or loſs the Return of every Ship at the end
of her Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age produceth: beſides at every Quarter Aſſembly the
Governours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are to give an account of the whole Tranſaction
ſince the laſt Aſſembly, and themſelves receive an account every
month of the<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61834:121"/>proceed of the Officers, and how they
obſerve the Inſtructions and Inſtitutions of the general Aſſembly,
which are always recorded in the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
                     <p>Then the general Aſſembly of the original Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> at their annual Meetings have the whole tranſaction of the
year paſt, with its product preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them fairly ingreſſed by the
Regiſter, of which as many of them as deſire it may have Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, and at
the ſame Meeting they elect their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, his Deputy and Counſel of
Aſſiſtants for the enſuing year, and regulate what they find de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
in the laſt years Tranſactions; and make a new Eſtablishment for the
enſuing years Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, from which the Governor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt not
vary, without firſt ſummoning a general Aſſembly, and propoſing the
matter to them; at which Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the Divident is to be made of the paſt
years Profit, which every man may either receive, or otherwiſe have it added
to his Capital in Bank, and ſo increaſe his Stock there.</p>
                     <p>So that upon the whole, the Stock in Bank is never out of
the owners poſſeſſion, nor view, but lieth as ready and as viſible as
his Cash in his own coffer.</p>
                     <p>And although the original Bankers cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their
Stock, to the weakening of the grand Capital, yet they may aſſign it to
others, which the Company will be obliged to accept; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe give the
ſame Rate others offer for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; ſo that a Stock in Bank will
not be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſo much hazard as in a Merchants own<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61834:121"/>hands, managed by his own Factors or Servants, or in a Gentlemans
hand managed by his Steward, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in regard few perſons are
capable of keeping a dayly check upon their private concerns, either in
reſpect of capacity, or time to perform it. Thus having not only propoſed
the erecting a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, who by united Stocks and Councils will propagate
and improve the Trade and Wealth of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but alſo ſtrengthened
my Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Examples of all Kingdoms and States flourishing in
Trade, who have greatly increaſed their Trade and Wealth thereby, and

                     <p>Beſides, this Affair, upon the Foundation of the Law of

ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to both Kingdoms, in executing the Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Tranſporting our <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wools into Foreign parts, which hath been
the bane of the Clothing Trade of <hi>England</hi> as well as <hi>Ireland;</hi>
for by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of our <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wools both <hi>France</hi> and
the <hi>Low Countries</hi> have been able to work up their own Wools to the
height of our <hi>English</hi> Staple, which otherwiſe they were not capable
of; for as the Wools of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the more ſoutherly parts of
<hi>France,</hi> are too tender and fine for ſtrong, thick Cloth, ſo the
Northerly Wools are too courſe and harsh to produce it; but mixing our Wools
with either, they produce Cloth of what ſort they pleaſe; by which
advantage the great Trade for Woollen Manufacture of the <hi>Hamborough,
Eaſtland</hi> and <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy</hi> Companies are much damnified, who
vended the greateſt proportion of our Northern courſe and middle Cloths,
<hi>&amp;c. Poland, Sileſia, &amp;c.</hi> having not only much increaſed
the number of their Sheep, but improved the Staple of their Wools of late
years, and encouraged great numbers of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Weavers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſettle amongſt them; beſides the Prince Elector
<hi>Palatine</hi> hath carried over into his Country many thouſands of
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Families, all Artiſts in the Woollen Manufacture, within
theſe<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61834:123"/>twenty years: But if the tranſporting of our
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Wools could be prevented, it would put a violent check to
their progreſs, for which we have good and ſevere Laws, only want perſons
intereſted to proſecute and execute them; and it would be the intereſt of
this Corporation, to uſe their utmoſt diligence therein, both in order to
increaſe their own Manufactures for the ſupply of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations, and
diſcourage foreign Manufactures to preſerve their Market. And as it would
be much their Intereſt, ſo will they be in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to effect it above
any other Judicatures, by the advantage of their Factors and Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
in all Ports, who will eaſily diſcover all attempts of that kind,
eſpecially having the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and obſerving the method of the Staple,
which,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Limits the Tranſportation of ſtaple
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to certain known publick places, to be bought and ſold, as

Cuſtom paid, to be expreſs'd in the Cocket at that time; every Sack of Wool
paid ſix shillings eight pence, two hundred Wool Fells twenty shillings, a
Laſt of Leather thirteen shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings four pence, and every Sow of Lead three
pence; Foreigners paid a third more beſides the Merchant, to take an Oath

Staple beyond the Sea of the ſame Commodities accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the 27th. of
<hi>Edward</hi> the Third, Chap. 1. State Staple. Now if our Anceſtors found
reaſon to keep this methodical Check upon the Tranſportation of Wools only,
to preſerve the Kings ſmall Duty, before <hi>England</hi> attained the
Woollen Manufacture, much more ought there now to be a ſtricter Check
obſerved, when not only the Kings great Duty, but Manufacture, which is the
Wealth and Glory of the Country, depends upon it.</p>
                     <p>And for <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Staple being confined to the

                     <p>Theſe Rules being obſerved, I dare undertake to anſwer
for every pound of Wool wrong tranſported, and without ſome ſuch

shillings upon every Sack of Wool tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported for ſix years, and at the

                     <p>In the 37th. of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, it was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him for two years, to take twenty ſix shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and eight pence upon

(not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Kings Oath, and other great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates) was ordained to

Staple of Wool was ſo removed from <hi>Calice,</hi> to divers Towns in
<hi>England,</hi> contrary to the Statute, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing, that Citizens and
Merchants should keep it there, and that the King might have the Profits and
Cuſtoms, with the Exchange of the Gold and Silver that was there made, by all
the Merchants in Chriſtendom, (eſteemed to amount to Eight thouſand
pounds by the year) the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge only; and the Citizens and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
ſo ordered the matter, that the King ſpent nothing upon Souldiers, neither
upon Defence of the Town againſt the Enemies; whereas now he ſpent Eight
thouſand pounds by the year: in the 51th. year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third,
when the Staple was ſettled at <hi>Calice,</hi> the Mayor of the Staple did
furnish the Captain of the Town, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any Road, with one hundred Bill-men and
two hundred Archers, of Merchants and their Servants, without any Wages.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1388. the 12th. of <hi>Richard</hi> the

                     </p>
                     <p>In the 14th. of his Reign there was granted for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty shillings

                     </p>
                     <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth had ſix Wool-houſes

                     <p>Now by this account of the Staple, it is eaſie to imagine
of what a high value it was both to the Kings and Parliaments of
<hi>England,</hi> for upwards of 200 years no new Corporations for Trade were
conſtituted; and as they increaſed in Trade, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated of its ancient
vigor and ſplendor, after it had worn out all Foreigners, and reſcued the
Clothing Trade from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that the Wools of <hi>England</hi> were
prohibited, the Tranſportation of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its chief ſupport.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Ireland</hi> yet tranſporting moſt of its Wools,
it can lay the Foundation of a Corporation for the Increaſe of its Foreign
Traffique upon no better baſis; the Statute Staple being yet in force in

Trade and Wealth is manifeſt, though it hath been its ruining fate, to have

                        <p>For it is with Politick as with Natural Bodies, whilſt
the peccant Humour that ſeeds the Diſeaſe is moſt predominant, the Body

and that this is <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> preſent caſe is manifeſt; for if it
be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that before the laſt Rebellion the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt was potent.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Irish</hi> were far the greater number of
Proprietors of Land, poſſeſſing ten Acres for one;<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61834:127"/>whereas now of the Ten millions eight hundred ſixty eight
thouſand nine hundred forty nine Acres, returned by the laſt Survey of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts are poſſeſt but of Two
millions forty one thouſand one hundred and eight Acres, which is but a
ſmall matter above the fifth part of the whole; and as the Proprietors of
Lands, ſo is it in their Plantations; for where there was one
<hi>English</hi> Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before the laſt Rebellion 1641. it is judged there
is three now: and in ſeveral of the principal Counties next adjacent to
<hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Wicklow</hi> and <hi>VVexford,</hi> where there was
ten <hi>Irish</hi> Papiſts to one <hi>English</hi> Proteſtant, the odds now
lies on the other hand.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Before 1641. their Intereſt in the Lands and
Popularity of the Inhabitants neceſſitated the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to admit them to
all County-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as High Sheriffs, Juſtices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherby they
had opportunity to encourage the <hi>Irish,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance the
<hi>English;</hi> but now not one <hi>Irish</hi> Sheriff, or Juſtice in the
Kingdom.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Before the Rebellion the chief Inhabitants of all
principal Cities and ſtrong Towns were <hi>Irish</hi> Papiſts, who bore all
Offices, and managed the chief Trade of thoſe places, all which places are
now planted, or at leaſt governed by <hi>English</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</p>

Proprietors of Lands, there were in <hi>Ireland,</hi> were not the Kings
Tenants; but derived their Titles from the <hi>Irish</hi> Noblemen and

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61834:127"/>and kept an awing influence over them; for though the

Lords of <hi>Ireland</hi> ruled as Kings, and were ſo ſtiled by the Kings
of <hi>England,</hi> as is obſerved by Sir <hi>John Davis</hi> out of

<hi>Audley Mervin,</hi> then Speaker to the Houſe of Commons, in his Speech

theſe particulars.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. As a free Act of Grace, when His Majeſty was
under no politick Obligation, but what meer Grace and Bounty mov'd him, to
which never any Grant before was; for though they were ſtill ſtiled Acts of
Grace, yet Reaſon of State inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for them; which will be eaſily
granted, if the State of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> be compared at

                              <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſtill treated with their Swords in their hands, or
at leaſt hid where they knew how to find them, if they were not anſwered in
their expectation; as in the Hiſtory of <hi>Deſmonds</hi> and <hi>Tyrones,
&amp;c.</hi> Rebellion is manifeſt.</item>
                           <item> 2. Former Grants did only diſpoſe of ſome
Countrys, or Lordships, to ſome few perſons who depended upon the Crown,
and all others upon them: but this of the whole Land, that was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
diſpoſed of; whereby there is more Tenants to the Crown ſettled by this
Act, above forty for one, than by any former Grants.</item>
                           <item> 3. Not only the Lands of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but all
the Cities and ſtrong walled Towns are ſecured in hands true to the Crown
of <hi>England</hi> by this Act, that never were before.</item>
                           <item> 4. By this Act there is a Revenue ſecured to the
King, ſufficient to maintain a compleat Army to preſerve the Peace, which
never was before.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Therefore I argue the ſtate of the Intereſt not only
of the Crown but of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> is altered, as to the
Freehold Intereſt above double, nay treble, to what it ever was before; the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> being in poſſeſſion, by that Act, of four millions
five hundred ſixty thouſand thirty ſeven Acres, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
but in two millions three hundred twenty three thouſand eight hundred and
nine, ſo that if the majority of Proprietors may give the<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61834:128"/>denominations to a Country, which uſually it doth, <hi>Ireland</hi>
is become <hi>Weſt England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Beſides this, the governing party univerſally
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth and only incourageth the <hi>Engliſh</hi> publick Worship; it

never was before; and all this adminiſtred by the abſolute Commiſſion
from the King of <hi>England:</hi> and muſt it yet be kept under, and
eſteemed of as an <hi>Irish</hi> Intereſt, and Country? when the very
Nature and civil Conſtitution of <hi>Ireland</hi> is altered; and
proportionably ought the Wealth and Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it to be promoted by
<hi>England</hi> for theſe Reaſons.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is the Intereſt both of the Crown and
Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> to enable the <hi>English</hi> Intereſt of
<hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> not only to ſupport its ſelf in peace, but to defend its
ſelf in war; which nothing but promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting its Trade and Wealth will do,
eſpecially the Wealth of its Cities and walled Towns: for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
its Wealth in the Fields, doth rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe its danger, by enouraging the
needy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives the rather to riſe, when they obſerve how eaſily they can
poſſeſs themſelves of ſo great a Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but the Wealth of the Cities
and ſtrong Towns, which is the trading Stock of the Nation, is ſecure, and
ready to be imployed in the defence of their King and Countries Intereſt,
when in danger: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they are the only ſecurity and refuge to the 
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61834:129"/>diſtreſſed <hi>English,</hi> when banished from
their Country Habitations; and theſe places of ſtrength cannot
ſubſiſt without Trade and Manufacture, but by more chargeable Gariſons
than the Revenue of <hi>Ireland</hi> will bear.</p>
                        <p>And what <hi>Ireland</hi> cannot do in order to its
ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>England</hi> muſt ſupply, to prevent its own danger; for if
ever an Enemy ſurprize and poſſeſs <hi>Ireland,</hi> eſpecially the
<hi>French, England</hi> muſt maintain a greater ſtanding Force to ſecure
themſelves, than would have preſerved <hi>Ireland,</hi> if imployed in its
Defence: it is not a groundleſs proverb, <hi>He that would</hi> England
<hi>win muſt with</hi> Ireland <hi>firſt begin;</hi> and if the
<hi>French,</hi> who hath already the oppoſite Coaſt, and Harbours from
<hi>Dunkirk</hi> to <hi>Breſt,</hi> ever obtain <hi>Ireland,</hi> they will
then ſurround three parts of four of <hi>England,</hi> and a great part of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> ſo near that in a few hours they may invade what part they
pleaſe; which would neceſſitate <hi>England</hi> to be at the charge of a
conſiderable ſtanding Army and Fleet, to prevent <hi>French</hi>
Invaſion, at double the charge of preſerving <hi>Ireland</hi> now: and the
Invader with two ordinary Squadrons of Ships, one at <hi>Breſt,</hi> and the
other at <hi>Baltimore, Bantrie,</hi> or any of thoſe bold Weſtern
Harbours, they would ſo diſtreſs the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> a Ship
should with much difficulty paſs Southward without a great Convey, but they
would ſeize him; and then poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the Wools of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
they would utterly ruine the Clothing Trade of <hi>England;</hi> and if
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe can, that will convince <hi>England,</hi> when too late, that
the ſtrength of the <hi>English</hi> Intereſt of<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61834:129"/>
                           <hi>Ireland</hi> is their Bulwark, as to foreign Invaſion of their
Country, and violent wreſting from thence their Trade.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Englands</hi>
neglect herein hath been the cauſe of that intolerable charge
<hi>Ireland</hi> hath coſt <hi>England,</hi> in preſerving and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering

his Hiſtory of the Rebellion of 1641. computes the Charge of <hi>England</hi>
in that War unto twenty two millions one hundred ninty one thouſand two
hundred fifty eight pounds three shillings; then compute the Charge of its
firſt Conqueſt by <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, with the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the ſeveral Rebellions from that time unto <hi>Tyrones</hi> Rebellion
1595. to coſt <hi>England</hi> but dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as much as <hi>Tyrones</hi>
Suppreſſion did, which (if <hi>Spencer</hi> miſtakes not) were every
ſeven years in the Queens time; and he writ his <hi>View of Ireland</hi> in
the later end of her long Reign of forty four years, which were at leaſt
ſix Rebellions in the Queens time; (and it is evident by our Hiſtories, as
I have noted in my Catalogue, <hi>Ireland</hi> never enjoyed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years
peace together from its firſt Conqueſt to that time;) then <hi>Ireland</hi>
hath coſt <hi>England</hi> twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four millions five hundred eighty eight
thouſand ſix hundred ninty two pounds, which is near three pounds
<hi>per</hi> Acre, one with another, for all the Land<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61834:130"/>they
poſſeſs in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which is above double its value now, and
above four times its worth to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe <hi>Anno</hi> 1172. when
<hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered it; and ſo ſenſible were our
Predeceſſors hereof, that in the 11th. year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
Sir <hi>Henry Sidney</hi> Lord Deputy, in the Preamble to the Act of Parliament
for a Subſidy they thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed themſelves to the Queen, <hi>viz.
Conſidering the infinite maſſes of Treaſure, able to purchaſe a
Kingdom, that your moſt noble Progenitors have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted for the
Government, Defence and Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Majeſties Realm of</hi>
Ireland: and in the body of the ſaid Act thus; <hi>We for the Alienation of
ſome part of your Majeſties ineſtimable Charge do revive the ſaid
Subſidy:</hi> yet after this <hi>Deſmond,</hi> and (towards the later end
of the Queens Reign) <hi>Tyrone</hi> were chargeable Rebels to
<hi>Ireland:</hi> and that moſt excellent Governour, of whom
<hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion</hi> gives this Character; <hi>A man much beloved, ſtately
without disdain, familiar without contempt, very continent, learned in many
Languages, a great Lover of Learning, skilful in Antiquities, in utterance
happy,</hi> &amp;c. This Noble perſon, who had ſpent the moſt part of his
Life in <hi>Ireland, viz.</hi> from the third of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to the
thirteenth of <hi>Elizabeth, March</hi> 25. 1571. in his moſt elegant Speech
in Parliament, printed at large by <hi>Campion,</hi> in Reply to ſome that
grumbled at the Charge of the Army, reaſons thus; <hi>Many a good fellow
talks of</hi> Robin Hood, <hi>that never drew in his Bow, and many an idle Head
is full of Proclamations,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but let me ſee which of them can
juſtifie that</hi> Ireland <hi>can<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61834:130"/>ſpare the Army,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Are your Enemies more tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable, are they fewer, are your ſelves
of force to match them? if you be, then were</hi> England <hi>ſtark mad, to
disburſe thirty thouſand pounds a year, for no other purpoſe but to vex
and grieve you; that were like the Husband who gelded himſelf to anger his
Wiſe,</hi> &amp;c. whoſe Arguments are ſtill in force, for the keeping up
a potent Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Charge.</p>
                        <p>I could give many inſtances of the vaſt Charge
<hi>Ireland</hi> hath put <hi>England</hi> unto, above what it was ever worth
to purchaſe; all which intolerable Charge hath proceeded from the not
improving the <hi>English</hi> Intereſt in <hi>Ireland</hi> by Trade and
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures; whereby the <hi>English</hi> Planters have been conſtrained to
betake themſelves to Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry amongſt the <hi>Irish</hi> for their
livelihood, and the <hi>Irish</hi> being better acquainted with the nature of
the Soyl, and accuſtomed to a more frugal way of living, have eaten up the
ſubſtance of the <hi>English,</hi> by which they have been conſtrained to
court their Friendship; and by their Foſterings, and mixtures by Marriage,
multitudes of them have embraced their Religion, Cuſtoms and Manners, and
dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated to their Intereſt, as was manifeſt in the laſt Rebellion;
the ſtrength of the <hi>Irish</hi> conſiſted in the degenerate
<hi>English.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And as <hi>Ireland</hi> is thus altered in its Eſtates,
ſtrong Holds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> treble to what it ever was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; ſo the
Inhabitants, both <hi>Irish</hi> and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate old <hi>English,</hi> are many
of them now <hi>English</hi> Proteſtants; there are many of the <hi>Tooles,
Burns,<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61834:131"/>Cavenaghs, Releys, ô Neales, ô Bryans,
ô Moores, ô Sulivants, Mac Cartys, Mac Laughlins, Mac Guires,
&amp;c.</hi> are now <hi>English</hi> Proteſtants: and more might have been
long ſince, ſaith <hi>Spencer,</hi> if the <hi>English</hi> Government had
done their parts, to have ſupplied the Country with learned, pious, and
painful Preachers, that would have out-preach'd, and out-liv'd the
<hi>Irish</hi> Prieſts in holy and godly Converſations, which that moſt
intelligent Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of <hi>Englands</hi> Defects in the <hi>Irish</hi>
Affairs, <hi>pag.</hi> 113. ſaith thus; <hi>In planting of Religion thus much
is needful to be obſerved,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that it be not ſought forcibly,
to be impreſſed into them with terror, and ſharp penalties, as now is the
manner; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delivered and intimated with mildneſs and gentleneſs,
ſo as it may not be hated before it be underſtood, and their Profeſſors
deſpiſed and reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And therefore it is expedient, that ſome
diſcreet Miniſters of their own Countrymen be firſt ſent over amongſt
them, which by their meek perſuaſions and inſtructions, as alſo by
their ſober lives and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, may draw them firſt to
underſtand, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to embrace the Doctrine of their Salvation: for
if the ancient godly Fathers, which firſt convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, when they were
Infidels, to the Faith, were able to pull them from Idolatry and Paganiſm to
the true Belief in Chriſt, as St.</hi> Patrick <hi>and St.</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumb;
<hi>how much more eaſily ſhall godly Teachers bring them to the true
underſtanding of that which they already profeſs? wherein it's a great
wonder to ſee the odds which is between the Zeal of Popiſh Prieſts, and
the Miniſters of the Goſpel; for they<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61834:131"/>ſpare not to
come out of</hi> Spain, <hi>from</hi> Rome, <hi>and from</hi> Rhemes, <hi>by
long toyl, and dangerous travelling hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where they know peril of Death
awaiteth them, and no Reward or Riches is to be found, only to draw the people
unto the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>whereas ſome of our idle Miniſters,
having a way for credit and eſtimation thereby opened unto them, and having
the Livings of the Country offered unto them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pains, and without
peril, will neither for the ſame, nor any Love of God, nor zeal of Religion,
nor for all the good they may do, by winning Souls to God, be drawn forth from
their warm neſts, to look out into Gods Harveſt, which is even ready for
the Sickle, and all the Fields yellow long ago; doubtleſs thoſe good old
Fathers will (I fear me) riſe up in the day of Judgment to condemn them:</hi>
thus this great Scholar and true Proteſtant avers, the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is not
to be planted by penal Laws, or the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of punishments, which may fill a
Church with temporiſing Hypocrites, but never with ſincere Profeſſors;
nor is it to be propagated by a vitious, ſlothful Miniſter: So
<hi>Heylin</hi> writing of the <hi>Irish,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>For their
Religion they either adhere to the Pope or their own ſuperſtitious
Fancies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and it is no wonder they should, there being no care
taken to inſtruct them in the Proteſtant Religion, either by tranſlating
the Bible or</hi> English <hi>Lyturgy into their own Language,</hi> &amp;c. And
to manifeſt the <hi>Irish</hi> are as capable of Conviction as others, he
inſtances in <hi>Ric. Fitz Ralph</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> who
flourished <hi>an.</hi> 1350. a declared enemy to the Errors and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions

that have been in the Governments and Clergy, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent many of the

they, but divers Noble and Worshipful Families of great Intereſt in their

Crown and Realm of <hi>England,</hi> to promote the proſperity of the
<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Intereſt in <hi>Ireland;</hi> ſo it is equally the
Intereſt of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts themſelves to aid and promote
the ſame; their contrary apprehenſions have been their ruin: for from
thence have proceeded all their bloody Maſſacres and Rebellions; and though
it hath coſt <hi>England</hi> vaſt quantities of Blood and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to
ſubdue them, yet they paid the Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at laſt, to the utter ruin of
moſt of the great Lords and Septs: and juſt it should be ſo, if the Right
and Title of <hi>England</hi> to what it poſſeſt, and endeavoured to keep
in <hi>Ireland</hi> be impartially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
                        <p>If we omit what all our Hiſtories record of the ancient
Soveraignty the Kings of <hi>Britain</hi> claimed, and enjoyed in
<hi>Ireland;</hi> as that in the time of <hi>Gur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntius, Anno Dom.</hi> 359.
they were his Subjects, and after that in the time of King <hi>Arthur Anno</hi>
519. above 600 years before <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it 1172. the
King ſummoned all the Kings and Lords of <hi>Ireland</hi> to attend
<hi>Gilmarrow,</hi> their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and with him perform their Homage at
<hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle,</hi> which they all did accordingly.</p>
                        <p>And only conſider the juſtneſs of the Cauſe of
<hi>Strongbow</hi> and his Comrades in their firſt Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it was not
only with the conſent, but at the deſire of their own King; they contracted
with <hi>Dermot Mac Morrough</hi> King of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> a banish'd
oppreſſed Prince, to aid him in the recovery of his juſt Rights, a
quarrel not only approved to be juſt, but charitable, by all Caſuiſts,
Pagans, Turks,<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61834:140"/>Jews, and Chriſtians, to relieve and
aſſiſt the weak and oppreſſed againſt the ſtrong Oppreſſor,
and what was the juſt Right of <hi>Mac Morrough</hi> to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, was in his
power to diſpoſe, and lawful for his Aiders to receive; it being their due
by contract before they would adventure, that <hi>Strongbow</hi> should have
delivered <hi>Mac Morroughs</hi> only Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Heir in Marriage, and his
Kingdom after her Fathers deceaſe, and that <hi>Fitz Steephen</hi> and
<hi>Fitz Girald, &amp;c.</hi> should have the Town of <hi>Wex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and
two Cantreds of Land adjoyning, which places were accordingly gained by their
Sword, and given them in poſſeſſion by the legal Proprietor; and had
they been permitted quietly to enjoy this ſmall part they ſo rightfully
poſſeſt, they had gone no further.</p>
                        <p>But inſtead thereof, <hi>Roderick</hi> King of
<hi>Connaght,</hi> then ſole Monarch of <hi>Ireland,</hi> raiſeth the whole
Kingdom to drive out <hi>Mac Morrough</hi> and his <hi>Welſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> upon
which he appeals to <hi>Strongbow,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes former contracts, who
haſts over with about 1200 fresh Men, by them wars with the
<hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordians,</hi> who were in Arms againſt him, took the City, and
married the Kings Daughter, with an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the Reverſion of the
Kingdom, and ſoon after diſperſes his Enemies, then ſurrendred all his
Conqueſts to the King, who came over with a new Force to ſecure his
Intereſt, which ſo terrified the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that all their Kings and
great Lords proffered to to be tributary, and ſwore Allegiance; and had they
ſo continued, they had felt no farther damages.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="75" facs="tcp:61834:140"/>But no ſooner was the Kings back
turned, but they are again up in Arms, to diſpoſeſs the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> of what they had ſo juſtly atchieved, who ſtill
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued them, and gained ground of them, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Grants of their new
Conqueſts until all the <hi>Irish</hi> Kings and great Lords were vanquished,
and their Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> poſſeſt by the <hi>English</hi>
Victors: the Heirs of <hi>Ulſter</hi> and <hi>Connaght</hi> married to the
Kings Subjects, whoſe ſucceſſive Heirs in proceſs of time were
married unto the Royal Family; and ſo their Lands and Honours came Hereditary
in the Crown, who of right diſpoſed of them at pleaſure.</p>
                        <p>Now had it not been the Intereſt as well as the Duty of
the <hi>Irish,</hi> to have ſubmitted to their firſt Conceſſions? Then
<hi>Dermot Mac Morrough</hi> had ſuſtained no wrong, his right Heir had
enjoyed his Dominion, and the reſt of the <hi>Irish</hi> great Lords had
enjoyed their particular Rights; none preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to diſturb them, until
conſtrained in their own defence.</p>
                        <p>So if we take a further view of their many
Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and perfidious Rebellions, ſince they held their Honours
and Lands from the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> it will appear they were tempted
to it by the weakneſs of the <hi>English</hi> Intereſt; as in times of
troubles in <hi>England</hi> by the Barons Wars, and Struggles betwixt the two
Roſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When the Kings of <hi>England</hi> drew over part of their

which did not only weaken <hi>Englands</hi> Strength in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but
divided what<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61834:141"/>were left into powerful Factions betwixt the
great <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords of <hi>Ireland;</hi> which became the cauſe of
the ruine of that great Family of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> with ſeveral others of
good Rank, who, though dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from their <hi>Engliſh</hi> Civilities,
yet after they turned Rebels againſt their Prince, they fell whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly off to
the Intereſt, Manners and Cuſtoms of his and their own former
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Enemy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Ireland</hi> was to be new conquered and
replant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for the degenerate <hi>English</hi> were more ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Rebels,
and with more difficulty ſubdued, than the rebellious Natives; for although
their Minds and Manners were degenerated, they had ſo much <hi>English</hi>
Blood left in their Veins, as gave them <hi>English</hi> Courage and
Reſolution, whereby <hi>Tho. Fitz Giralds</hi> and <hi>Deſmonds</hi>
Rebellions became harder work to ſubdue, than any before them, they alſo
receiving great Incouragements and Aids from the Pope and King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> upon the account of Religion, they became obdurate; the ſame
Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences that were granted to the Souldiers fighting againſt the
<hi>Turk</hi> in the holy War being ſent them, whereby their Conſciences
were not only releaſed from their Obligations of Allegeance to their Prince,
but ſtrongly engaged on the behalf of holy Church, <hi>to extirpate that mad
and venemous Doctrine and Helliſh Opinion,</hi> as the Proteſtant Faith was
then termed, in a Pamphlet then pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd, intituled, <hi>A Declaration of the
Divines of</hi> Salamanca <hi>and</hi> Vallidolid, diſperſed through
<hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by <hi>O Sullivan</hi> a <hi>Spanish</hi> Prieſt; which,
with divers other practices of the <hi>Irish</hi> to shake off the 
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61834:141"/>
                           <hi>English</hi> Government, is rehearſed and preſs'd
by that pious Prelate, Primate <hi>Usher,</hi> the Glory of the <hi>Irish</hi>
Proteſtant Church, in his elegant Speech to an Aſſembly of all the States
of <hi>Ireland, April</hi> 1627. in which he defends my Aſſertion that it
is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the <hi>Irish,</hi> to aid and ſupport the Proſperity
of the <hi>English</hi> Intereſt amongſt them: and had they had Grace to
have believed him, ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of <hi>Irish</hi> Families, now utterly
ruined, might have been in a proſperous ſtate: And after he had minded them
of their traiterous tendering the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of <hi>Ireland</hi> to the
<hi>French</hi> King, and upon his refuſal to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> which
was by him accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for although <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France</hi>
was not Apoſtate enough to invade his Proteſtant Neighbours, yet
<hi>Charles</hi> the fifth of <hi>Spain</hi> and his Son <hi>Philip</hi> were
Papiſt enough to admit the Popes Donation which the <hi>Irish</hi> obtained;
for them Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good enough not only to claim <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade it
with ſeveral Armies of <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> who landed
at <hi>Kinſale</hi> and <hi>Kerry,</hi> to their coſt, but alſo to
attempt <hi>England</hi> by their ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed invincible Armado in 88. but
the invincible juſt God did not only deliver us from their power, the Sword
deſtroying his Land Souldiers in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Sea ſwallowing
up his Naval Force aſſayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>England,</hi> but alſo from that time
blaſted the Counſels and Succeſſes of that aſpiring Monarch, that
their Fame and Potency hath ever ſince dwind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led away. <hi>Portugal</hi> and
the <hi>Low Countries</hi> ſoon after revolted; and the ſtately
<hi>Don,</hi> who then talk'd and acted as proudly as <hi>Monſieur</hi> doth
now, was<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61834:142"/>ſo far from beeing able to invade his
Neighbours, he hath been put to his shifts to ſecure his Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Countries: and, as old as I am, I hope to live to ſee it the caſe of
<hi>Monſieur;</hi> who, though now ſtiled the moſt Chriſtian King, hath
declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the moſt inveterate Enemy to the moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Faith and Profeſſion in the Chriſtian World; and let but the Defender of
the Faith turn his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects looſe, with his Commiſſion in their pockets,
they would ſoon covince him of it; and let him know that the <hi>English</hi>
Blood that inſpired their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors at the Battel of <hi>Agincourt,
&amp;c.</hi> is boyling hot in their Veins, and that <hi>Charles</hi> the
Second may be as dreadful to <hi>France</hi> as ever was <hi>Henry</hi> the
fifth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when he pleaſeth, if our God hath not given us up,
for our impious provocations, to be a prey and a ſpoil, as he did
<hi>Iſrael</hi> to the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and haſty Nation.
But to return to my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it is the Intereſt of the <hi>Irish</hi>
Papiſts to further the Proteſtant <hi>English</hi> Intereſt in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> I shall return to my reverend Author, ſaith he, <hi>They
put me in mind of the Philoſophers Obſervations, that ſuch who have a
vehement reſpect to a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour things are eaſily miſled to overlook
many great things; ſo,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they have ſo deep a ſenſe
of their preſent burthen of contributing ſmall matters towards the
ſupport of the Kings Army, to ſecure us from foreign Invaſions, that they
overlook all thoſe miſerable Deſolations that will come upon them by a
long and heavy War, which the having of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in a readineſs may be a
means to prevent: the lamentable effects</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>of the laſt
Wars in this <pb n="79" facs="tcp:61834:142"/>Kingdom doth yet freshly ſtick in our
memories: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we ſo ſoon forget the Depopulation of our Land;
when, beſides the combuſtions of War, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of Famine grew ſo
great, that the very Women, in ſome places by the way ſide, have
ſurpriſed the men that rode by, to ſeed themſelves with the flesh of
the Horſe and the Rider: and that now again here is a Storm towards,
whereſoever it will light every wiſe man will eaſily foreſee, which if
we be not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to meet with in time, our eſtate may prove irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable,

and Gentlemen, that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from us in point of Religion, imagine that
Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Profeſſion will exempt you more then us from the danger of a
common Eenemy; what you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from a Foreigner, you may conjecture by the
An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer which the Duke of</hi> Medina Sidonia <hi>gave in this caſe in</hi>
88. <hi>That his Sword knew no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Catholick and a Heretick,
but that he came to make way for his Maſter, and what kindneſs they looked
for from the Countrymen that were to joyn with them, they might judge as well
by the carriage which they ordinarily uſed towards them both in the Court and
Colledges abroad, as by the Advice, not long ſince, preſented by them unto
the Council of</hi> Spain, <hi>wherein they would not have ſo much as
the</hi> Irish <hi>Prieſts and Jeſuits that are deſcended of</hi>
Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <hi>Blood to be truſted, but would have you, and all yours, to be
accounted Enemies to the Deſigns of</hi> Spain, <hi>in the Declaration
published about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Inſurrection of</hi> James Fitz Morice
<hi>in the South, the Rebels profeſſed, it was no part of their 
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61834:143"/>meaning to ſubvert</hi> Honorabile Anglorum ſolium,
<hi>their Quarrel was only againſt the perſon of Queen</hi> Elizabeth
<hi>and her Government: But now the caſe is otherwiſe; the tranſlating of
the Throne of the</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <hi>to the power of a Foreigner is the thing
that is mainly intended, and the re-eſtablishing the</hi> Irish <hi>in their
ancient Poſſesſions, which by the valour of our Anceſtors were gained
from them. This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you may aſſure your ſelves,</hi>
Manet alta mente repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum, <hi>and makes you more to be hated of them, than
any other of the</hi> English <hi>Nation whatſoever.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The danger thereof being thus common to us all, it
ſtands us upon, to joyn our beſt helps for avoiding of it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus you may ſee what deep Sentiments this great good
man had of <hi>Irelands</hi> danger many years before that terrible Earthquake
in 1641. tumbled down its peace and proſperity into its firſt Chaos, of
which this holy Prieſt became a true Prophet 40 years before the Blow was
given, in ſeveral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons preached before the Government, yet in print to be
read.</p>

diſcourſing concerning the Prophets bearing the Iniquity of <hi>Judah</hi>
40 days, accounting a day for a year, he made this direct application in
relation to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance at Popery at that time; <hi>From this year,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>will I reckon the Sin of</hi> Ireland, <hi>that thoſe whom
you now embrace ſhall be your ruin, and you ſhall bear this iniquity:</hi>
which fell out exactly true both in point of time and thing, he alſo foretold
all the Troubles that befell <hi>England</hi> both relating<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61834:143"/>to Church and State, and lived to ſee them come to paſs
accordingly; as Dean <hi>Bernard,</hi> who writ his Life, and others have
obſerved; and alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded ſome of his prophetical Expreſſions near
his end, of miſeries yet to come upon the Church of God, as followeth.</p>

                           <hi>He being asked whether he thought that great Perſecution (which
he had formerly ſpoken of to fall upon the Proteſtant Churches) were
paſt, or yet to come, he then turned his eyes towards the face of the
enquirer, and fixing them there in a ſtrange kind of manner, as he uſed to
do when he ſpake not his own words, and when the power of God was upon him,
ſaid; Fool not your ſelf with vain hopes of its being paſt: for I tell
you, what you have ſeen is but the beginning of ſorrow to that which is to
come on all the Proteſtant Churches, which e're long will fall under a
ſharper Perſecution than ever yet they have had upon them, and that by the

Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies this way as any, yet with me it is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that ſo great
a Prophet, ſo ſanctified from his youth, ſo knowing, and eminent
throughout the univerſal Church, might have at ſome ſpecial times more
than ordinary motions and impulſes, in doing the Watchmans part, of giving
warning of Judgments approaching.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But doubtleſs the Spirit of that holy man, like juſt
<hi>Lots</hi> righteous Soul, was grieved with the filthy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of
the wicked; being well skilled in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61834:144"/>Aſtrology might
prognoſticate from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Conſtellations, that a people, like thoſe
of <hi>Laiſh, who dwell careleſs, quiet and ſecure, when there
is no Magiſtrate to put them to ſhame for the moſt ſcandalous provoking
ſins,</hi> Judg. 18.1. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction was near when the iniquitys of the

that faithful Watchman now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, to behold a deluge of profeſs'd
Prophaneneſs and Debauchery committed with a bold contempt of Gods and Mans
Laws, to ſee men glory in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions Heathens are ashamed of, he would conclude
the time of the fulfilling of his Prophecy was near, even at the doors.</p>
                        <p>But ſo obdurate were the <hi>Irish</hi> then againſt
all that could be ſaid or done to oblige them to peace, and ſo ſtupified
were the <hi>English</hi> by their long peace, and great plenty, accompanyed
with grievous Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, nothing could reclaim them, but the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Judgment of God executed on them by thoſe <hi>Irish Sabeans</hi> and
<hi>Chaldeans,</hi> or rather <hi>Cannibals;</hi> for the firſt did but
ſpoil <hi>Job</hi> of his Goods, but theſe eat the Flesh and drunk the

                        </p>
                        <p>So great delight and pleaſure did they manifeſt in the
miſerable diſtreſſes and tortures they put the <hi>English</hi> under,
no tongue can expreſs the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inhumane Cruelties committed by them on
all<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61834:144"/>Sexes, Degrees and Ages, that in a few months they
deſtroyed (ſay ſome) one hundred and fifty thouſand, others, two
hundred thouſand Chriſtians, many of whom knew not their right hand from
the left, and moſt of them innocent naked people, in no capacity to
reſiſt, nor under the leaſt ſuſpicion of danger; many of them
preſuming upon their old intimate acquaintance, and long friendly
neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood amongſt them, would not ſlee; concluding their late
familiarity and mutual obligations of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could not ſo ſoon be
forgotten, until they ſaw the Skean at their throats, and then they cryed
out, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the Senate Houſe, <hi>And thou my Son</hi>
Brutus! ſo, What thou my old Neighbour! thou my Goſſip! thou my Foſter
Father, or Foſter Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! what thou my near Kinſman! <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But
ſo vehement was their rage, no former Allies nor Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations would be
remembred, nor no bowels moved; many who had been prevailed with to ſit up
all the night before carouſing and drinking in Taverns and Ale-houſes,
where they had drank ſo many Healths to the Grandees they favoured,
themſelves were ſick, or rather dead drunk, and were ſo murdered in the
morning by the ſame Companions before they were capable of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who
hurt them, or had time or ſenſe to ask God forgiveneſs, their Barbariſm
extending to their Souls as well as to their Bodies, frequently refuſing them
time to ſay their Prayers, ſwearing they would ſend their Souls
preſently to the Devil; and ſuch as, through the terror of ſudden Death,
would go to Maſs, and promiſe to turn Papiſts, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently 
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61834:145"/>murdered, leaſt they should recant, ſaying, they
should dye while they were in a good mind.</p>
                        <p>An account of the particulars for the firſt three months
of this diſmal Tragedy is recorded by Sir <hi>John Temple,</hi> Maſter of
the Rolls, and one of His Majeſties moſt honourable Privy Council, a
perſon ſo univerſally applauded for his Prudence, Gravity and Integrity,
that the Truth of his Hiſtory never was or ever will be queſtioned by any,
but thoſe whoſe works of darkneſs hate the light; a Book worth the
chaining to every Churches Desk, and reading over once a year by every Family,
to prevent that ſtupidity that is overgrowing the minds of too many
Proteſtants, who are ſucking in with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs their debauch'd
Principles in Morals, which ſo naturally blind the mind, they will eaſily,
when it shall ſeem to be their intereſt, ſwallow down full cups of their
Superſtition, and cloſe in with that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, where the moſt crying
Sins of prophane Swearing, beaſtly Drunkenneſs, and abominable Adulteries,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be pardoned for mony, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either Repentance or
Reformation, as is cited by the Author of <hi>the Myſtery of
Jeſuitiſms</hi> out of Father <hi>Bauny Filcutius Sagundus Eſcober,</hi>
and other of their Caſuiſts. <hi>Vide Letter</hi> 10. 137,

                        </p>
                        <p>Now all this rage and barbarous cruelty could not proceed
from inveterate malice and revenge againſt their perſons; for they had not
given any provocation, nor from any depravity in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from principles
of Humanity; for a more kind, affable, obliging humour'd people are not to be
converſed with, than the generality of them, who<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61834:145"/>have
been educated amongſt the <hi>English,</hi> or other ways well bred: they are
capable of the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in all the liberal Sciences, and
ingenious Arts; that, as <hi>Heylin</hi> ſaith of them, <hi>if good there is
no better, if bad there can be no worſe;</hi> but this cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty proceeds from
theſe two cauſes.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. From the bloody Principles infuſed into them by
their Prieſts, who perſuaded them it was no more ſin to kill a Heretick
than a Dog or a Pig, nay to pluck a bone out of a Dogs mouth, Dog being the
frequent Epithete they gave the <hi>English</hi> whilſt murdering them, and
this back'd with a perſuaſion it was not only innocent but meritorious to
deſtroy them, in order to promote the Catholick Cauſe, &amp; that they
should receive a great share of that vaſt ſtock of Indulgences ſent over
by the Pope for their incouragement, blew their Catholick zeal into ſuch a
hellish flame, it put them into ſuch an extaſie of joy, they ſo ſtrove
who should moſt merit, they had no leiſure to conſider, thoſe innocent
<hi>Abels</hi> Bloods would cry to Heaven for vengeance againſt ſuch
curſed <hi>Cains.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Sir <hi>J.T.</hi> p. 78, 85,

                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. As they were perſuaded God would reward this
labour, ſo were they confident it would never be in the power of man to
punish them; and that their opinion proceeded from the viſible weakneſs of
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt, whereby they concluded the total extirpation
of it was an eaſie work; and obſerving the Herds, Flocks &amp; Corn of the
<hi>English,</hi> with the rich Furniture of many of their Houſes, the
preſent poſſeſſion of which, if they had had no eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
entail'd upon them, was a violent temptation<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61834:146"/>to a company
of Beggers, who little before would have eſteemed themſelves very rich if
they had but two Cows and four Goats of their own; for the Gentlemen who were
Officers had their eyes upon the Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they left the Plunder
much to the Scolognes and contented themſelves to buy good bargains of them,
and they that were confident of obtaining as much more before morning would
ſell good pennyworths over night, that in a few days thouſands of wealthy
Families that, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>were clothed in Scarlet embraced
Dunghils,</hi> had no other rayment to cover their nakedneſs but thum-ropes
of ſtraw, which theſe jovial Catholicks would fire in a frolick,
expreſſing great pleaſure in beholding how thoſe deſolate miſerable
Chriſtians would frisk and fret, or at the beſt filthy rags thrown away by
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Beggers, whilſt the Beggers themſelves, like
<hi>Dives,</hi> were well clothed <hi>and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red deliciouſly every
day.</hi> But now let the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivors of them ſit down and caſt up their
accounts, did they gain by all this any thing but ſwift deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and
deſolation? what the Sword ſpared the grievous Famine and dreadful
Peſtilence devoured, that within leſs than ten years after their delicious
Feaſt they paid ſuch a diſmal Reckoning, they wished they had contented
themſelves with their own Commons.</p>
                        <p>About the years 1652, and 1653. the Plague and Famine had
ſwept away whole Countrys, that a man might travel twenty or thirty miles,
and not ſee a living creature, either Man, Beaſt or Bird, they being either
all dead, or had quit thoſe deſolate pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61834:146"/>that our
Souldiers would tell Stories of the place where they ſaw a Smoak, it was ſo
rare to ſee either Smoak by day, or Fire or Candle by night, and when we did
meet with two or three poor Cabbins, none but very aged men with women and
children, and thoſe, with the Prophet, might have complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>we are
become as a bottle in the ſmoak, our skin is black like an Oven, becauſe of
the terrible Famine.</hi> I have ſeen thoſe miſerable creatures plucking
ſtinking Carrion out of a Ditch black and rotten, and have been credibly
informed they have digged Corps out of the Grave to eat; but the moſt
tragical Story I ever heard was from an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer commanding a Party of Horſe,
hunting for Tories in a dark night, diſcovered a Light, which they
ſuppoſed to be a Fire which the Tories uſually made in thoſe waſte
Countries to dreſs their provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and warm themſelves, but drawing near
they found it a ruined Cabbin, and beſetting it round, ſome did alight and
peep in at the window, where they ſaw a great Fire of Wood, and a company of
miſerable old Women and Children ſitting round about it, and betwixt them
and the Fire a dead Corps lay broyling, which as the Fire roaſted they cut
off Collops and eat.</p>
                        <p>That doubtleſs the Vengeance of God was as ſevere upon
that bloody Generation, as it was on <hi>Edom, Ezek.</hi> 25.12.
<hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that</hi> Edom <hi>hath dealt
againſt the Houſe of</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, <hi>by taking Vengeance, and hath greatly
offended, and revenged himſelf upon them:</hi> 13. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith
the Lord God, I will alſo ſtretch out mine Hand</hi>
                           <pb n="88" facs="tcp:61834:147"/>
                           <hi>upon</hi> Edom, <hi>and will cut off Man and Beaſt from it, and
I will make it deſolate from</hi> Teman, <hi>and they of</hi> Dedan <hi>shall
fall by the Sword.</hi> 14. <hi>And I will lay my vengeance upon</hi> Edom
<hi>by the hand of my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and they shall do in</hi>
Edom, <hi>according to mine anger, and according to my fury, and they shall
know my vengeance, ſaith the Lord God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And ſo ſenſible were the moſt ſober and
judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous amongſt them of their miſery, that about that time they approved
this Notion of mine, that it is the Intereſt of the <hi>Irish</hi> Papiſts
of <hi>Ireland</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the ſtrength of the <hi>English</hi>
Intereſt there to that height, that may utterly cut off their hopes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
withſtanding it; they might be able to reject all tenders from abroad, and
all encitements from their Jeſuited Prieſts at home with this short
anſwer, <hi>Put us not upon imposſibilities, and irrational deſperate
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts;</hi> we now quietly enjoy our Eſtates, Lives, &amp; liberties of
Religion, ſo far as can rationally be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a Prince of a different
communion, with friendship from our <hi>English</hi> Neighbours, equal
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Laws for the peaceable enjoyment of our Eſtates, and
incouragement to trade and plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And having been ſo
often deluded by you, to the ruine of ſo many thouſands of good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Families, and the reproach of our Religion, we are reſolved to run no more
ſuch ruining courſes, after ſo many deſtructive diſappointments, that
we and our Anceſtors have met with by dancing after your pipe. I ſay, were
the <hi>English</hi> Intereſt ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, that all rationall hopes of
extirpating it were removed, the <hi>Irish</hi> would be out of danger of being
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61834:147"/>prevailed with, to make ſuch deſtructive attempts to
themſelves and poſterities as they have formerly done: for although a
conſiderable number of them may be of deſperate fortunes, being Branches of
thoſe ruined Families ſequeſtred for former Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, to whom War is
the beſt Trade, and Revenge deſireable Wages, if they gain nothing, they
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not loſe much, but this is not the caſe of the body of them, there are
many of their Nobility and Gentry enjoy plentiful Eſtates, with the favour
and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their Prince, ſome of whom never quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Intereſt
of the Crown in the laſt 12 years War, and now reap the profit of it: and
multitudes of the Commons are wealthy Merchants in our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and rich
Farmers in the Country, who although they be ſtrict Papiſts, yet are
friendly and good Neighbours, and juſt and honeſt Dealers, who have as much
reaſon to dread a War as the <hi>English</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when out of their
Catholick Frenzy, at leaſt on ſuch deſperate terms as a well fortified
<hi>English</hi> Intereſt would render it.</p>
                        <p>I have diſcourſed many of them about this laſt
<hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi> Plot, who have not only blamed but curſed their Prieſts,
for a company of vagrant beggerly fellows, who having nothing to loſe, nor
any Families to provide for, would hazard the lives and fortunes of others that
have both, who deſire to be quiet; and that the Prieſts themſelves are
not all of a mind, nor act by the ſame rebellious Principles is manifeſt by
the Diſcoveries ſome of them have made, and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they have given
againſt their own Primate <hi>Plunket</hi> and others lately.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="90" facs="tcp:61834:148"/>Now from theſe and the like
conſiderations I argue, it is the Intereſt of the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Papiſts, that are in any tolerable ſtate to live, to promote and
ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt amongſt them to that height,
that may render all attempts againſt it irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and deſperate; which
would not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their minds to Peace and honeſt Induſtry, but
diſcourage Foreigners from invading, when they had little hopes of Welcome or
Aid from any of the Natives of Eſtates or Intereſt: this would in time wear
off all the Jealouſies, and remove all Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of both ſides, that a
weak and feeble <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt in <hi>Ireland</hi> will continue
and nourish: this would diſcourage Tories and Wood-Kirnes from robbing and
harming the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Farmers, if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Farmer were
convinc'd it were equally their intereſt to diſcover and ſuppreſs
them.</p>
                        <p>This would encourage the Natives to build and improve upon
the Eſtates they have left, if they were convinc'd, that new Wars and
troubles would hazard what they have, rather than reſtore them to more.</p>
                        <p>This would encourage the Tradeſman and Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to their
utmoſt Induſtry, when they could be aſſured, that what they thereby
attained would be peaceably enjoyed by them and their poſterities.</p>
                        <p>Nay, a potent <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt would be a
pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful motive to moderate and diſpoſe the better tempered, and moſt
thoughtful amongſt them, to inquire into the Differences about Religion, when
they find themſelves out of danger of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergies power,
who now keep them in ſuch awe,<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61834:148"/>they dare not read the
Scripture, nor any Proteſtant Author, nor confer with any Proteſtant
Miniſter, leaſt the Prieſt hear of it, and enjoyn them ſeverer pennance
than for Swearing, Whoring, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And from whence proceed this dread
and awe, but from a ſuppoſition, it may be poſſible to retrieve the
Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Intereſt again, and then they would be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the ſevere
Diſcipline of the <hi>Romish</hi> Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy for their Diſobedience and
Apoſtacy? and multitudes there are, both Papiſts and others, that would
change a dangerous for a ſafe Religion, if they could be ſecured there were
no danger in the change; for all Religion founded on humane Laws bind the
Conſcienſes no longer than thoſe Laws are in force: and as the Law is
altered, ſo muſt the Religion, when the fear of man and ſelf-ſafety,
more than the love of Truth and deſire to pleaſe God, is the motive to
profeſs it.</p>
                        <p>And nothing is more evident, than that the Fear of God
they have, is taught by the Precepts of Men: and therefore comes within the
circuit of that vain Worship our Saviour rejects, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.9. they
cannot with <hi>David</hi> ſtand in aw of Gods Word, the Standard of all
Divine Worship, and Rule of all humane Society; whilſt they are prohibited
the reading it, it may be well ſaid of them, as Chriſt ſaith,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 22.29. <hi>Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures:</hi> if their
Prieſts tell them, it is not only lawful, but meritorious, to deſtroy all
Heriticks, yea Heretical Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if it tend to promote the
Catholick Cauſe, they muſt believe them, having never read, that <hi>they
that reſiſt the Power reſiſt the <pb n="92" facs="tcp:61834:149"/>Ordinance of God,
and they that reſiſt receive to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves damnation:</hi> if their
Prieſts affirm the Pope is ſupream over all Princes and worldly

<hi>Peter,</hi> though claimed for their own pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Apoſtle, from whoſe

God. Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance
of God: and they that reſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelves
Damnation:</hi> So that the Pope and his Clergy muſt prove they are no Souls,

shall reſpit my more particular Anſwer to the Supplement at the end of this

                        </p>

Extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they should attempt another Rebellion; and that an equal
Proſperity with their <hi>English</hi> Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours they do and may enjoy, if
they pleaſe. I shall cloſe this Chapter with this Repetition, that if it be
more their Intereſt to be in ſafety than in danger; to be in equal capacity
of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Truſt from their Prince with his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Subjects, than
excluded; if it be their Intereſt to enjoy the Fruit of their Labours, and
leave their Poſſeſſions and Wealth to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, rather than to
have them poſſeſs'd by others; if it be their Intereſt to enjoy the
hearty good Will and Reſpects from their Proteſtant Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, rather
than their Prejudice, ariſing from their Jealouſie and Dread of being
maſſacred, robbed and ſpoyled by them; in a word, if it be their
Intereſt to ſecure to themſelves and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities a ſettled
proſperous ſtate, rather than to be ſubject to frequent ruine and
deſtruction; then it is their Intereſt to promote the Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity 
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61834:152"/>of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt amongſt them: for

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> will do it, your 41. Experience may convince you, all that may
be immediately ſurpriſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by your Enemies, and put them in
a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to maintain a deſtructive War againſt you, but the well
planting our Wall Towns, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting them where they are wanting, and
keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in a poſture of defence by their own Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia's, which will be
ready Receptacles to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Families diſperſed in the

againſt an Enemy, that would fortifie the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt; and
this may be eaſily effected, without much charge to the King or Country, by
propagating Manufactures, as I shew at large in that Treatiſe.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Expedient is to procure Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſingle Life, enjoyning all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants to marry, the
Males before the age of 25. and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males before the age of 22. or from that
time to pay a yearly penalty by Statute, to be preſented by the Grand Juries,
and limited by the Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bench not exceeding the eighth part of
their viſible Incomes, to be imployed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the maintenance of poor

                        <p n="1">1. This would ſomewhat reſtrain theſe
abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Fornications and Adulteries, ſo frequent, if we would take St.

every Woman her own Husband,</hi> &amp;c. other mens Wives would not be ſo

                        <p n="2">2. This would much increaſe an <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Breed for the Countries Defence, as I elſewhere ſhew, ten of whom are worth
twenty bred and brought up in <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The neglect hereof gives the <hi>Iriſh</hi> a great
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, who are generally more fruitful, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides inure their

and Courage, yet their Bodies are ſo inured to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and delicacy,
the hardſhips of Winter War would kill more than the Sword.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. This would much tend to the planting our Towns:
for ſingle perſons content themſelves with a Room in anothers Houſe;
and Marriage would neceſſitate them to become Houſe-keepers, and Families
would require their Induſtry to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but while ſingle they live
idlely, if not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchedly.</p>
                        <p>And in order to encourage the meaner ſort to marry, to
countenance that ancient <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cuſtom of Bridals, wherein every
perſon not receiving Alms in the Pariſh brings in ſomething, according to
their ability, towards the young Couples Houſekeeping, to the great
incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<pb facs="tcp:61834:154"/>of painful induſtrious young people; and obligeth
them, whilſt ſingle, to be the better La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers and Servants, that their

                        <p>And further, that a proviſion be made, where Parents are
not able to diſpoſe of their Children to honeſt Trades, to put them out
Apprentices on the Country Charge, which would much tend to the planting of our
walled Towns, and promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Manufactures, as I ſhew at large in that
Treatiſe.</p>
                        <p>But that which would, above all other Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, tend to
the ſtrengthening the <hi>Engliſh</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt would be, to endeavour a
right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and charitable Union betwixt all ſober pious
Proteſtants in matters of Religion, the want thereof increaſeth
groundleſs Jealouſies of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſtrengtheneth the Confidence of
the common Enemy to the Proteſtant Intereſt, that they are eaſily run
down, as in the Maſſacre 1641. they at firſt declared their
diſpleaſure was only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Puritannical party, and then only the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> not the <hi>Scots:</hi> but, I ſuppoſe, I need not
inform you how ſoon all Proteſtants became the equall objects of their Fury
and barbarous Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</p>
                        <p>Therefore by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants I mean all
that are not Papiſts, and agree with the Religion eſtabliſhed by Law in
all its Fundamentals, nay in all its Subſtantials, that believe the ſame
Creed, and make the ſame Tranſlation of the Scriptures their Rule of Faith
and Manners; and no people<pb facs="tcp:61834:155"/>can be eſteemed of a different
Religion, that agree in what is <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> though they differ in
ſome things that are <hi>Jure Humano.</hi> Although they may ſcruple
external Communion with ſome particular Churches, yet if they retain internal
Communion with the univerſal Catholick Church in all parts of the world, they

                        <p>And as they agree in all eſſential poſitives, the

bleſſed Martyrs, and are ready, if God call them to it, to ſeal the
Truths they dyed for with their deareſt Blod; they bleſs God for, and
heartily rejoyce in, all her learned and pious Biſhops and Miniſters, that
now are, and daily pray that God would increaſe their Numbers and bleſs
their Labours in his Work, and grieve for all the Reproach and Diſhonour
brought upon the Church by ignorant and ſcandalous Miniſters,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> they agree with the Church at leaſt in 36 of the 39
Articles, and are therefore doubtleſs of the ſame Religion. The Jews had
their ſeveral Sects, as the Phariſees, the Sadduces, the Herodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,

                        <p>Some of the <hi>German</hi> Proteſtant Princes are
<hi>Lutherans,</hi> and others are <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and their Subjects

generality of Diſſenters.</p>
                        <p>The Papiſts themſelves, who glory much in their Unity,
have their <hi>Janſeniſts, Dominicans, Moleniſts, Jeſuiſts,
Scotiſts,</hi> and ſeveral Orders, whoſe Differences are more momentary
by far than any of ours, ſome of them even to the ſhaking of the bottom of
their very Faith, as might be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced in their diſputes about the Subject
of Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, ſome placing it in a Council, as the Councils of
<hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Conſtance,</hi> others in the Pope, as the Councils
of <hi>Lateran</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> ſome in both; yet they own each other
of one Religion. Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> in his <hi>Synopſis</hi> fol. 1325 to
1352 incerts 307 Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies<pb facs="tcp:61834:157"/>amongſt the Papiſts, many of
them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated by Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet, vid</hi> his <hi>Diviſions of the
Romiſh Church,</hi> from pag. 353 to 471. And as they have theſe many
diſtinct Sects maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary Opinions amongſt their Clergy and
Votaries; ſo betwixt the Clergy and Laity, as is at large aſſerted by
Biſhop <hi>Taylors Diſſwaſive from Popery,</hi> Biſhop
<hi>Jewel,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> ch. 4, and 5. and the
<hi>Hiſtory of the Council of</hi> Trent, fol. 33, 39.44. wherein you may
read the bitter Conteſts about Eccleſiaſtical Power and Juriſdiction
betwixt Pope and Pope, the Popes and the Emperors of <hi>Germany,</hi> Kings of
<hi>Spain, France, Portingal,</hi> States of <hi>Venice, Italian</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and States, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> producing bloody Wars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet
were all eſteemed <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks.</p>
                        <p>But admit this were not the caſe, but the
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters were as oppoſite in Principle and Intereſt to the
Proteſtant Church as the Papiſts, that they eſteemed them all damn'd
Hereticks, and their Religion a peſtilent Hereſie, and that it were not
only lawful but meritorious by all poſſible means, whether by War,
Maſſacres or Aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to deſtroy them, as the Enemies of
God and holy Church; yet they could not be dangerous to the Common-wealth,
becauſe of the paucity of their Numbers, and Indepency of their Intereſt:
if the Papiſts were as few in number, and had as few Noblemen and perſons
of Intereſt to head them, and no Foreign aid to back them, more potent, nor
neerer than <hi>Maryland,</hi> all men would eſteem it ridiculous for the
State to maintain a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent<pb facs="tcp:61834:158"/>Army to ſecure the Intereſt of the
Crown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, or to obſerve the Proteſtants in dread of being
deſtroyed by them, eſpecially if this ſmall number of Papiſts were ſo
far divided in their Opinions, there were no probability of their ever agreeing
which Faction ſhould ſway the Scepter, having no Family or perſon that
made the leaſt pretence to a right of Soveraignty: I ſay, if this were the
caſe we ſhould laugh at per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons dreading Popiſh Plots and Rebellions,
as we do at our little Children when they point to their own Shadows, and cry a
Bug-a-bo! and yet this is the beſt capacity the Diſſenters of
<hi>Ireland</hi> are in to diſturb the State: and if ſo, ſurely thoſe
Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are blind of one eye, at leaſt, that warn the State to beware of
Puritans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous than Papiſts: For, admit
Diſſenters were perſons of dangerous Principles &amp; conſiderable
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, there are few of them of deſpicable Fortunes, the pooreſt of
them by their painfulneſs in their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and frugality have Bread to eat,
and Rayment to put on, and moſt of them live comfortably by their Induſtry;
and ſome of them enjoy plentiful Eſtates by Title from the Crown, whereby
they are equally engaged with others to preſerve the Peace, and ſupport the
Intereſt of it, until their caſe be as deſperate as blind
<hi>Sampſons,</hi> when he pull'd down the Houſe on his own head to be
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> for his two Eyes, I ſee no reaſon
they ſhould be eſteemed dangerous to the Peace of <hi>Ireland;</hi> but
rather a great additional ſtrength both to Church and State, both againſt 
<pb facs="tcp:61834:158"/>Foreign Invaſions and inteſtine Rebellions; they own no
Government nor Juriſdiction that is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, nor any other but that which
the Laws of the Land have eſtabliſhed, to which they have ſworn
Allegiance, and are and will be ſubject not only for Wrath but for
Conſcience ſake, ſo far as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the great end of Government: few
pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Stateſmen but will judge it is the Intereſt of the State of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> conſidering its circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, not only to continue
their Indulgence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe they have, but to declare a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all
Proteſtants of what Nation or Opinion ſoever principled, as before is
declared, which has been the Practice of all Princes and States court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Trade; as I ſhew at large in the the <hi>Chapter of the Policies of
Trade.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I never read of any Prince or State that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
their diſſenting Subjects, but from one of theſe conſiderations.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. From Conſcience, to propagate Truth and
ſuppreſs Error; but this way of converting Souls by Priſon, Baniſhments
and Death I read not hath been much in uſe with Proteſtant Princes or
States ſince the Reformation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Or Jealouſie of the Safety of their Intereſt,
and in this caſe it is irrational, for any ſort of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,
Papiſts or others, to expect Protection from that Prince, or State, to whom
they will not give the beſt Security in their power of their Allegeance and
peaceable deportment. The States of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>New England,</hi>
who pretend the highlieſt to Liberty, exact it: and it is a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple 
<pb facs="tcp:61834:159"/>in Nature for every Being to provide for its own ſaftety, much
more for that Being on whoſe ſafety all others depend.</p>
                        <p>Therefore it is not only the Duty but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of
all Diſſenters, not only to give the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſecurity for their Loyalty
in their power, but to avoid all occaſions of appearing engaged in any
Faction that may happen in the State: for though the matters controverted be
only of a civil nature, and have no tendency to Religion, but rather the
ſafety of the State, and Honor of the Prince; yet that ſide Diſſenters
ſhall general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear for will be reflected on by Churchmen, if not by
Stateſmen, to deſign ſome Faction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Government; that were I
to chooſe a Parliament man, or a Magiſtrate of a City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I
would neither give my Vote for a Diſſenter, nor for a prophane debauched
Conformiſt, if there were a ſober, pious, good Church-man to be had.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As Diſſenters in prudence ought to be of no
Faction in a State, ſo to avoid all manner of juſt provocations toward the
Governors, whilſt they enjoy the liberty of worſhipping God in the way
their own Conſciences dictate, it is not reaſonable they ſhould expect
the liberty of reflecting on that Religion the Law of the Land eſtabliſhes,
by which they are indulged: there is little ground to believe any of the godly
perſons we read of, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> in
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, good <hi>Obadiah</hi> in wicked <hi>Ahabs, Daniel,
Nehemiah</hi> and the three worthies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> the
Chriſtians in <hi>Ceſars</hi> Houſhold<pb facs="tcp:61834:159"/>did carry
themſelves offenſively towards their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Courtiers, much leſs towards
their Princes they ſerved, though moſt of them Pagans: it is not rational
to ſuppoſe any of thoſe good men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved or cenſured the Religion of
their Princes publickly: but it is manifeſt they made a publick
profeſſion of their own, and more vehemently when it was moſt dangerous
ſo to do; as <hi>Daniel</hi> when the King publiſhed his Decree,
<hi>Chapt.</hi> 6. and <hi>Obadiah</hi> when by the inſtigation of
<hi>Jeſabel Ahab</hi> perſecuted the Prophets, and <hi>Mordecai</hi> and
<hi>Eſther</hi> when <hi>Hammon</hi> contrived the deſtruction of the Jews:
but whilſt they were permitted quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enjoy their own Worſhip, I do
not find they either writ or ſpoke againſt the Religion of the Country they
were in: and St. <hi>Paul</hi> diſapproves it, being accuſed by
<hi>Tertullus</hi> the Orator before <hi>Felix</hi> for a mover of Sedition,
and prophaning the Temple, <hi>&amp;c. Acts</hi> 24.6. he denies the Charge,
<hi>v.</hi> 12. ſaith he <hi>they neither found me in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diſputing
with any man, neither raiſing up the people, neither in the Synagogue, nor in
the City,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but this I confeſs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by the
way they call He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, ſo worſhip I the God of my Fathers,</hi> v. 14.
that is, I meddle not with their Religion, nor mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of State, but practice
my own, I only preach the Goſpel of Peace and walk as becomes it: ſo in his
ſecond Arraignment before <hi>Feſtus, chap.</hi> 25, <hi>chap.</hi> 18. he
makes his defence thus, <hi>neither againſt the Law of the Jews, neither
againſt the Temple, nor yet againſt Ceſar have I offended any thing at
all,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:61834:160"/>Now if theſe things had not been faults
St. <hi>Paul</hi> would not have endeavoured to vindicate, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have
juſtified himſelf; he was no time-ſerver nor man-pleaſer, 1
<hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4.</p>
                        <p>So in his third Arraignment before <hi>Agrippa, chap.</hi>
26. how humbly and condeſcendingly did he expreſs himſelf, as before to
the other two, and when the King told him, <hi>too much Learning made him
mad,</hi> v. 24. or a Fanatick, he humbly replied, <hi>I am not mad, moſt
noble</hi> Feſtus, <hi>but ſpeak the words of truth and
ſoberneſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now if theſe things be written for our learning, how
unlike it is, the ſpirit and behaviour of ſuch Chriſtians under
ſufferings for Conſcience ſake, that think they can never bear a faithful
Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, except they do it ſtubbornly and rudely? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let
Diſſenters, who wiſh well to the common Proteſtant Intereſt, be
cautious whilſt they preſs after Goſpel Purity they break not the bonds
of Goſpel Unity; and whilſt they ſeperate from what they judge humane, to
be wary, they reject not what will prove divine Worſhip, though there may be
a juſt and pious Separation, as Biſhop <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi> (before cited)
delares.</p>
                        <p>Yet there may be alſo a ſinful Schiſm, as every
particular Sect allows, when it is from themſelves; and an Error in Schiſm
will be found a greater Sin when it proceeds from Pride of mind and
Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedneſs, than an Error in Conformity when it proceeds from
Charity and a godly fear of ſinning on the other hand.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:61834:150"/>Therefore it is ſafeſt to ſeparate
from things ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than perſons or Churches, to own every Church ſo far as
they own the Truth, and only ſeparate from what is in your Conſciences
mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Error and Superſtition, Biſh. <hi>Bramhall</hi> p. 271.</p>
                        <p>Go as far as upright Conſcience will give leave to
manifeſt a love to Union and an hatred of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion; and that it may appear
you ſeparate not through Stubbornneſs and Faction, but ſingly to maintain
a good Conſcience towards God, and that with all Chriſtian Charity and
Humility to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others, eſpecially your Superiors: this would ſuit with
St <hi>Peters</hi> Advice <hi>to be ready always to give an account to every
man of the hope that is in you with meekneſs and fear,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.15. and
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure you from ſuffering as evil doers and buſie bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes,
<hi>&amp;c.  for it is better, if the will of God be, that you
ſuffer for well doing than for evil doing,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Peter</hi> 1
Epiſtle 3.17.</p>
                        <p>If I be cenſured for this part of my Diſcourſe by
the peeviſh and cenſorious of both ſides, for a Digreſſion from a
Subject of promoting Trade and Wealth; yet when the more moderate and judicious
conſider the influence of our Diviſions and Jealouſies fomented by rigid
uncharitable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of both parties, they will vindicate me, and allow that
the uniting of Intereſt in point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſo far as to beget a mutual
confidence in each others Integrity to the common Proteſtant Cauſe, will
tend much to the ſtrengthening the

<pb facs="tcp:61834:151"/>Aſſenters and Diſſenters that they will never be
dangerous one to another: and till this be obtained I ſee no ground to expect
the Proteſtant Intereſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> can ever be potent, nor ever
flouriſh in Trade and Wealth, for theſe Reaſons.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The common Enemy to our common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and
civil Intereſt will ſtill be hoping the Diviſions amongſt our ſelves

deters them from that Induſtry in Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factury and Traffick, which
otherwiſe, for preſent profit ſake, they would more vigilantly promote,
and the more moderate of them joyn Intereſt with the united Proteſtants in
preſerving our common Peace.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. No greater Diſcouragements can lye in the way

which the leaſt apprehenſive muſt diſcern would be an evident ruine to

                        <p n="3">3. Nothing more diſheartens the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
from engaging in ſuch Manufacturies and Trade as would fix their Eſtates on
a ſpot they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from, than a ſenſe of danger from our

                           <pb facs="tcp:61834:151"/>I might multiply particulars to manifeſt

lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing ſtate of <hi>Ireland</hi> in its Trade and Wealth is, to
aſſert <hi>Irelands</hi> Intereſt in its own Government.</head>
                     <p>THat it is not only the Intereſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but
of the Crown and Realm of <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> be governed
by its own members, or perſons peculiarly intereſted in its proſperity,
is manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>Although it will be granted to be <hi>Irelands</hi> great
advantage, to have not only their Lord Lieutenants but moſt other Miniſters
of State ſent from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> provided they then purchaſe, plant,
and ſettle themſelves and Families in the Country; for no other Expedient
will advance the Proſperity, and ſtrengthen the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Intereſt in <hi>Ireland</hi> like it: for if the Noble and Worſhipful
Families of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> would examine the original of their firſt
An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſtors in that Kingdom, few would be found that came over on purpoſe to
purchaſe or plant, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incouraged to tranſport themſelves for the
ſake of publick Imploys, either Civil or Military; but moſt by the later:
every new Rebellion called over new Troops and Companies, to ſtrengthen the
ſtanding Army to ſuppreſs it; and at the end of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very War were
garriſon'd and quarter'd in thoſe Countreys, where the Inſurrection was
firſt rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or had been moſt powerful, and in places moſt 
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61834:160"/>convenient to ſecure the future peace, where they
obtain'd Grants of forfeited Lands, and from thence after ſome time of
ſettlement of themſelves and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milys, their Soldiers would marry, and take
Farms, or ſet up Trades, and ſo erect <hi>English</hi> Plantations in the
moſt dangerous <hi>Irish</hi> Countries, where none but Souldiers with their
Swords in their hands, or others under their shelter durſt adventure to
plant.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it was a rational project at the end of the laſt
War, in order to promote the <hi>English</hi> Plantations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the disbanding part of that Army, to pitch upon
ſuch Troops and Companies as were beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Country, and
moſt likely to plant their Lots; and then to give ſome of them peculiar
advantages by ſelect places for their incouragement, whereby many of the
reducted Troops and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies had the advantage of the ſtanding Army, who
were confin'd to their Lots.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To contrive the planting of the Country by the
ſtanding Army, by inſtructing the Officers to encourage their Souldiers to
marry, and plant about their Garriſons, and Quarters, eſpecially if
Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and paſt their middle age: and then once in 2 or 3 years to
change their Quarters at a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the place, whereupon the
married Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that had ſettled their Familys would petition to be
diſmiſt, which much increas'd <hi>English</hi> Plantations, who for their
incouragement were continued in Muſter ſix months Duty free: and whilſt
Pay is to be had a General shall never want Souldiers, and young beardleſs
Lads that have nothing to care for,<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61834:161"/>but to keep their Arms
ſixed, and their Knapſacks furnished, are the beſt Souldiers for a
Field-Army, and ſo eſteemed by all Authors I have read: and whilſt a
Troop or Company retains one half old Souldiers, <hi>viz.</hi> File-leaders,
Half File-leaders and Bringers up, the young Souldiers will do as well as
others to fill up Files, and after a few months care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Exerciſe will be as
ready for any Service, and perform their parts equal with the reſt: for
though Experience and Skill is neceſſary in Officers, yet Courage and
Subjection are the more neceſſary Qualifications in private Souldiers;
which none like the young ſtripling, who is lately come from under the
ſeverer Diſcipline of Family Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to whom Military Diſcipline
ſeems eaſie: and theſe having no Wives nor Children to cry after them,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the freeſt from care, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the readieſt
at the Beat of the Drum to march where and whenſoever they are commanded.</p>
                     <p>The neglect of this was the ruine of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Intereſt the laſt Rebellion, the ſtanding Troops and Companies
conſiſting much of the Officers Tenants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> could not be
drawn together at short warning, without expoſing their Families and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns to the mercileſs mercy of the Enemy; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as had they been
qualified as beforementioned, the King might have had a marching Army, and the
Country a ſtanding Militia conſiſting of the ſame Inhabitants, march'd
from them in the Kings Pay, to have ſtood by them, and defended them, at
leaſt, againſt the ſmall parties of ſtraggling Cut-throats, by whom the
greateſt number of the<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61834:161"/>naked <hi>Engliſh</hi> were
maſſacred: therefore it is the Intereſt of this Kingdom, it should be
penal in the Officers of the Army to inliſt and muſter any of the ſettled
Inhabitants capable of ſerving in the Militia; for thereby the Country is
weakned in its Military ſtrength, and the King diſappointed of a marching
Army: whereas were all perſons thus qualified disbanded, and the Officers
prohibited liſting ſuch, without ſpecial Licenſe from the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, you
would ſoon have the Foot Companies filled with young brisk Lads, who would
throng out of <hi>England</hi> for Entertainment, which would more tend to
increaſe and ſtrengthen the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt in
<hi>Ireland</hi> than any other Expedient that can be propoſed.</p>
                     <p>As it is the Intereſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> to give
incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants to come and enjoy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Imployments and Preferments among them; ſo is it the ſame for Civil and
Eccleſiaſtical Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, provided ſtill they ſettle and abide with
us.</p>
                     <p>But that which is the Grievance of this Kingdom is, that
either Military or Civil Imployments should be enjoyed by Nonreſidents, or
otherwiſe perſons who only come over to enjoy the Profit of their Office,
and ſo ſoon as they have received what Benefit it affords, to return for
<hi>England,</hi> and carry their Gains with them; of which ſort,
<hi>Ireland</hi> has moſt ſuffered by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Chief Governours,
and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Farmers and Commiſſioners of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, and their
Attendants and Dependants coming and returning with them; the Damage
ſuſtained<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61834:162"/>by this Kingdom in the period of 15 years
thereby is computed in the Chapter of <hi>Irelands</hi> involuntary Charge and
Expence.</p>

                        <hi>The viciſitude of Governours hath been obſerved (by ſome) to be
exceeding prejudicial to the publick; private Reſpects often introducing

the</hi> Irish <hi>cuſtoms, through their negligence, and indulgence, other
times to the alienating the</hi> Irish <hi>by their ſeverity, from the
benefit of a well tempered and orderly Government, both equally deſtructive
to the Prince. And yet too long a Reſidence in ſo eminent a Place may
over-heat a great Spirit, if not bounded with excellent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Whence
the</hi> Romans <hi>(thoſe great Maſters of Government) rarely admitted
their Vicegerents to brood on a Province, that their Continuance there might
not increaſe Self-intereſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The longeſt time any continued in this Government (how
honourable ſoever) was never made up with Happineſs ſuitable to the
anxiety of their Mind and Body: Sir</hi> Henry Sidney <hi>(who left as clear a
Fame as any man that enjoyed the Place) parted with it with the words of the
Pſalmiſt,</hi> When <hi>Iſrael</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the

was his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> his Dominion; <hi>intimating how

ſuch a people, whoſe Language he knew not, and variety of Intereſts;
though the moſt that have miſcarried there, have fallen through other

                     </p>
                     <p>And I judge the three laſt Noble perſons ſent out of
<hi>England</hi> to govern <hi>Ireland</hi> will ſet to their Seals, that it
is not a short and eaſie work to underſtand their Humour and Intereſt;
none of them could pleaſe all, and others of them very few; although they
were perſons of eminent Parts and great Integrity, both to the Crown and
<hi>English</hi> Intereſt: yet the Intereſt of our Trade and Manufactures
ſo withered under their Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, that they languish to this day; of fourteen
hopeful Manufactures they ſound thriving, they left but the ſtumps of one
ſtanding; which hath put ſuch a Damp upon the hopes of Succeſs, none have
attempted either to erect new, or revive the old ſince.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They oft come with a prepoſſeſſion of the
danger of <hi>Irelands</hi> encroaching upon the Trade and Wealth of
<hi>England,</hi> and from thence rather fear than deſign <hi>Irelands</hi>

to hope for.</p>

Governors, new Councils; it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Succeſſor very rarely
elects the Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of his Predeceſſor to be his Confidents; and then
that natural Emulation the Heart of man is addicted to diverts them from
building on Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations laid by others; whereby ſome publick un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings

Lover of our Country, as being <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> our ſelves, and glory in
its Honour and Wealth, as younger Branches in the Honour and Wealth of the
elder Houſe of their Family; yet we may expect a younger Brothers Portion;
and to be truſted with the Conduct of our own Eſtates, in Subjection to our
politick Father; and not under the Tutelage of our elder Brother: When
<hi>Abraham</hi> ſent his Sons he had by <hi>Keturah</hi> from
<hi>Iſaac</hi> Eaſtward, and gave them Portions, he left them to manage
their own Affairs.</p>
                     <p>We do not read that ever the Sons of <hi>Iſaac</hi> or
<hi>Jacob</hi> were entruſted with the Affairs of the Children of

<hi>Irelands</hi> Chief Governours ſince the Conqueſt, I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the
Reader to the enſuing Catalogue, as I find it recorded by <hi>Borlacy,
Spencer, Campian, Hanmer, Marlburroughs, Hooker, &amp;c.</hi> wherein I have
only noted ſome few remarkable things that happened under ſome of their
Governments, deſigning only a brief Catalogue of both ſorts, to make good
my Poſition, that the Policy of <hi>England</hi> hath ſtill found it beſt
to govern <hi>Ireland</hi> by its own Members, or perſons peculiarly
intereſted in its proſperity. But this is obſervable, when Noblemen,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> were ſent out of <hi>England</hi> to govern
<hi>Ireland,</hi> it was not of choice, but rather of neceſſity; as in
theſe and the like caſes.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, to ballance Factions amongſt the <hi>English</hi>
Lords of <hi>Ireland,</hi> when their animoſities grew ſo high that
Intereſt of State required a more indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Hand at the Helm; which
proceeded from their great Power ruling their Tenants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as
So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Princes over large Teritories, by the <hi>Brehon</hi> Laws, whereby
multitudes both of <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> more depended upon their
Favour than the Kings: but that ſort of Lordship is utterly extinguished root
and branch, the greateſt Lords of <hi>Ireland</hi> are as ſubject to the
Kings Laws as the meaneſt man, and the whole Militia of the Kingdom under the
Kings immediate Commiſſion and Pay: therefore that Reaſon ceaſeth.</p>
                     <p>Second Reaſon was, to ballance Factions in the Court of
<hi>England,</hi> eſpecially in the Barons Wars, and in the Conteſt betwixt
the two Houſes of <hi>York</hi>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:61834:167"/>and <hi>Lancaſter,

upon one ſtalk, that danger is over.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in times of conſiderable Rebellions, when either
of theſe two Reaſons ſwayed.</p>

the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, <hi>Thomas</hi> the Son of
<hi>Gerrald</hi> Earl of <hi>Kildare,</hi> then Priſoner in the

<hi>Elizabeth</hi> imitated him in, for the moſt part; the like King
<hi>James</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt: but the reaſon thereof
muſt be attributed to the Change or rather Reformation of Religion; moſt of
the Noble Families of <hi>Ireland,</hi> capable of chief Truſt, ſtill
adhering to the <hi>Roman</hi> Superſtition, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently 
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61834:168"/>uncapable of promoting a Proteſtant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, which

1650. he left <hi>Clanrickard</hi> Deputy, until the 28th. of <hi>July</hi>
1662. when His Grace was again ſworn Lord Lieutenant; and as he hath

of any chief Governor ſince the Conqueſt: Firſt, Commander of an Army for
ſome years un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great wants, the hardeſt task to a noble ſpirited

Welfare of, that would not believe him until they found it to their coſt,
that their Ingratitude and Treachery to him and their Princes Intereſt, that
he aſſerted, ſell upon their own pates. Thirdly, Fighting for a Prince in
no capacity to ſupport him, much leſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him; yet when his Princes
State and Affairs were at the loweſt ebb his Loyalty was at hihgeſt, 
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61834:168"/>at full Sea, rejecting the greateſt proffers of
Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Eſtate from the Parliament, and choſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty in Exile with

Divine but Humane Laws and Policies have ſtill obſerved the ſame, where

                     <p>And from hence it was <hi>Paul</hi> pleaded the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

conſiſting of many diſtinct Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and States; yet all governed
by their own Princes and Senators, except what are in ſlavery; and they by
thoſe Colonies ſent to plant and keep them under: the like are the
Principalities and States of <hi>Italy</hi> under the Papal Regency; which I

                     <p>INSiſting more largely on the original Increaſe and
Value of all the ſpecies of Mony, that have been or now are currant in the

in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on this one Queſtion, it having been more controverted with
leſs agreement in the Council of Trade than any other point.</p>

maintained their Arguments from theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. 
<list>
                           <item>1. It would be a Dishonour to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Coyn
bring the Standard or Meaſure of all other things, it would weaken our Credit
in our foreign Traffique. 
<p>And alſo intringe the Laws of foreign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and
nothing more reflects upon a Prince or State than being inconſtant in their
Meaſures and Weights reſpecting Trade.</p>

                              <pb n="174" facs="tcp:61834:199"/>2. Silver and Gold being
foreign materials, we by inhancing their Value raiſe the rate of a foreign
Specie on our ſelves.</item>
                           <item> 3. If we raiſe its value, our Neighbour Princes,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> will riſe alſo, and then we are where we were.</item>
                           <item> 4. It leſſens the Repute of the Kings Revenue
when eſtimated by its currant Value much above its intrinſique.</item>

<list>
                           <item>1. All our Lands, Rents, Wares, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably undervalued, as we inhance or debaſe our Coyn, when the
currant value of one Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound in our Coffer is intrinſiquely worth but
ninty five pound, our Eſtate is no more really, though reputively.</item>
                           <item> 2. It will cauſe Controverſies and Suites of Law
in the paying of Rents and Specialties, when the Condition is currant lawful
mony of and in <hi>England.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item> 3. No man knows what he ſels his Goods for, when
he knows what ſort of Mony he shall receive payment in.</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>In brief, if our Mony, which muſt rule the Price of all
things, be mutable and uncertain, no man can make a ſure and clear eſtate
of what he hath; Contracts, Bargains, Rents, Taxes, Wages will all be
uncertain.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Objections contain the Subſtance of what were
offered in the negative.</p>
                     <p>Now though it is granted theſe Notions are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſound,
as to a well ſettled Commonwealth; yet, we ſay, there is no general Rule
without<pb n="175" facs="tcp:61834:199"/>an exception, for ſick States as well as ſick
Bodies Phyſick is more neceſſary than Food; and that this practice of
inhancing the Rate and debaſing the Value of the Coyn, hath been uſed by
the wiſeſt of Stateſmen upon ſome urgent caſes, our Hiſtories give
plentiful examples of.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, for the debaſing the Allay, though
<hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Bodin</hi> argues againſt it, yet himſelf gives many
inſtances as well in his own Countrey of <hi>France</hi> as in all other
Kingdoms and States of <hi>Europe,</hi> he determines the fineſt Gold to be
23 Carrets, and Silver 11 <hi>Deniers,</hi> that is one 24th. part Alloy in
Gold, and one 12th. part in Silver, and yet blames the Goldſmiths of
<hi>France</hi> 688. that they made their work at 20. yea, oft-times at 19
Carrets, and ſo it had about the 5th. part of Silver or Copper Allay, and
then ſpend five leaves in inſtances both of former and latter times of
Princes changing the fineſt, and value of their Coins, which may be not only
lawful, but expedient in theſe and the like cauſes: Firſt, in time of
Wars, or difference of Neighbour-Princes, who may contrive to draw out our
Money from us, in order to weaken our hands, and Moneys being deſervedly

moſt part of the Hance Towns in <hi>Germany,</hi> as they have had as good
Mony as the world affords, ſo they have as bad, which ſtands them in great
ſtead, as to their petty Commerce, that the Tradeſmen oft times give
Exchange to have the Rix-Dollar turned into baſe Mony of currant value,
though not the ſixth part of the intrinſique; ſo that although
<hi>Monſieur Bodin,</hi> and others of his opinion, deſerve the eſteem of
knowing and judicious perſons; yet I judge the contrary Practice of all
Princes and States we have any account of may ballance them; that ſuch may be
the ſtate of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, that debaſing and enhancing Coyn may be not
only expedient, but neceſſary: 
<list>
                           <item>1. In caſe of War, as before.</item>
                           <item> 2. If other Neighbour Princes inhance or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe
their Coyn, as in the Examples mentioned.</item>
                           <item>3. In caſe of Scarcity, and thereby increaſe of
the rate or value of Bulloin: for if <hi>England</hi> had not enhanced their
Coyn as Bulloin roſe, from 26 in <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds time to 60 pence
in Queen <hi>Elizabeths,</hi> it is not reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>England</hi> would have had a Silver ſpoon or a ſix pence left: and if
Bulloin ſhould yet increaſe in value to ſix or ſeven ſhillings
<hi>per</hi> Ounce, if we enhance not our Coyn proportionably, it is not
rational to believe we ſhall have a penny left.</item>
                           <item> 
                              <pb n="178" facs="tcp:61834:201"/>4. In eaſe of the wrong
Ballance of Trade, there is a neceſſity to do ſomething to alter it, or
the Kingdom's drained of its Coyn; for ſo much as we buy more than we ſell
muſt be paid for in Mony, as is ſhewn in that Chapter: and there is but two
ways to reform the Ballance of Trade, which is either to increaſe the
Quantity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Quality of our natural Growth, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
Conſumption of Foreign Goods: the firſt is a work of time, and the latter
difficult to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: and the moſt rational Expedient to ſtem the Tide till
it turn is, to make our Mony a worſe and our Commodity a better Commodity for
Tranſportation: for the Merchant only conſiders what is moſt gainful; and
whilſt our Coyn is the beſt Commodity to export, he will not meddle with
our Goods: but if Gold and Silver were the beſt Commodity to import, and the
worſt to export, there would need no other Law but the Common Law of
Intereſt to preſerve and increaſe Coyn.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>And although it might be more convenient for me to keep to
generals, and leave Expedients to thoſe more concerned, and capable to
reform: yet, conſidering I may be miſunderſtood, I judge it
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to explain my ſelf more particular in this caſe, there being
extreams on both hands: for the having of no good Mony in the Body politick
would be as dangerous as no good Blood in the Body natural.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I would propoſe that all our good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, either
<hi>Engliſh</hi> or foreign Coyn, that is near the<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61834:201"/>intrinſique value it goes for. <hi>viz.</hi> Gold of two in twenty
four, and Silver of one in twelve Allay may inhance five per <hi>Cent.</hi>
above its current rate in the Countries where we Trade, which cannot fall heavy
upon any but future Cofferers; and I think Five <hi>per Cent.</hi> is too low a
Fine upon them, and its increaſe of value would bring out all Mony now
coffered.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that all our courſe Mony may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in its
ſpecie, and coyned in Shillings, Six pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Threepences, to its
preſent intrinſique value, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt rate in Shillings, the
ſecond in Six pences, and the worſt into Threepences; whereby all perſons
will have their own at the ſame current and intrinſique value they
delivered it into the Mint, and the Mint deducting the Charge of Coyning, which
is ſo inconſiderable, the Mony will be little the worſe, and yet the
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of all perſons ſecured.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A certain Sum, as the Government may judge
convenient, of very courſe Mony, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Allay of the <hi>Dutch</hi>
double Stiver be coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Twopence and Penny pieces.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That the like proportionable Sum be coyned of
Copper, or rather Tin compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Copper (it being our own Material) in
Halfpence and Farthings; theſe three laſt ſorts of Mony we ſhall be
ſure to keep, which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will be ſufficient to manage our
Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trade, if our beſt Mony ſhould be drained from us, and if our native
Growth and Manufactures will not furniſh us with foreign Commodities
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61834:202"/>for our neceſſary Conſumption, we are
bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without them.</p>
                     <p>If we had fewer Silk-Shops and Taverns, it would be no great
Grievance, whilſt we want not Drapers and Mercers Shops, and Ale-houſes,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and no Country in the world leſs depends upon Foreign
ſupply than <hi>Ireland</hi> for Neceſſaries, and it is improvident to
conſume our ſelves in Superfluities.</p>

Good; yet the various In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of <hi>Ireland</hi> being undetermined, all
they could do was to keep all quiet, by keeping each party in expectation
matters might go better with them upon the Settlement than they feared, the
chief Contrivances of the people of each Faction being how to wipe themſelves
clean with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers foul Clouts, by alledging ſomething to exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate

in at his landing, all Intereſts being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled, and Minds unſatisfied,
both which were neceſſary to be compoſed and determined, before the
Improvement of the Kingdom by Trade could be thought on; for till men knew
their Intereſt in the Country, as to their real Eſtates, they had little
reaſon to be much concerned in improving their perſonal. Uncertain Titles
to Lands are always attended with certain omiſſions of Improvements; for
men are not willing to build Houſes for others to dwell in, nor to improve
Lands for others to poſſeſs.</p>
                        <p>Which was then more notoriouſly the ſtate of the
Inhabitants of <hi>Ireland</hi> in general than uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally befalls a Country,
which will appear, if you do but weigh the many diſtinct and contrary
Intereſts, producing ſeveral violent oppoſite Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Parties that
<hi>Ireland</hi> was under at the Dukes acceſs to the Government. And for
your Information or Satisfaction herein, take this brief view of the ſtate
from the year 1660. to the year 1662. the Duke arrived.</p>

Parliament of <hi>England:</hi> and therefore they hoped the worſt

the King under ſome ſort of neceſſity to ſatisfie the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
people of <hi>England,</hi> might be blunted.</p>
                        <p>A ſecond ſort, of them that pleaded they were not
concerned in the bloody Maſſacre and firſt Riſing; for they tendred
their Service to the Crown till they obſerv'd the Commotion to be ſo
general, and themſelves ſo far ſuſpected, they were not truſted, that
they had only choice which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they would be ruined by; and therefore fell
in with the reſt of their Country men, hoping by their Intereſt in their
Councils to prevent further Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, and to keep them in a capacity of
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting reaſonable terms of Submiſſion to the Government of
<hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A third ſort pleaded they accepted of the Ceſſation
1643. and cloſed in with the Peace in the years 1646, 1648. and from that
time were faithful to the Crown, and bore Arms in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of its
Intereſt againſt the Uſurpers; and many of them, after they could do the
King no further Service in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſerved under the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his
Friends beyond Sea, without the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, until the time his of
Majeſties happy Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and from thence they concluded they had made
amends for all their former faults.</p>
                        <p>There were a fourth ſort, who, though leaſt in number,
yet moſt deſerving, that pleaded In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61834:204"/>as
without any defect in the whole Tranſaction, and they expected not only their
own Eſtates, but Reparation for paſt Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                        <p>And as theſe ſeveral Intereſts and Factions of the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> thus divided them into parties, ſo was it with the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The unſpotted Royaliſts, that both in the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> War never ſerved under other but the
Kings Banner, they expected to be both firſt and beſt provided for, who had
a ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion made for them, though not what they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, by the
Act of Settlement, under the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Forty nine Men.</p>

                        <p n="3">3. They which ſeemed to be the moſt
conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, both for Number and Intereſt, being poſſeſt of the

Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, though by his Enemies Commiſſions; and they being ſuſpicious

of all thoſe Intereſts, it begat Factions both between<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61834:204"/>the Adventurer and Souldier, and between each party among

opportunity to thoſe Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts amongſt them, in that ſhuffle of the
Cards, to turn up the Kings Intereſt Trumps.</p>
                        <p>Now theſe many different Intereſts rendred the work of

                        <p>Thus all Intereſt being determined by the Act of

                        <p>Yet in that time the Duke conſidering, Land in

<hi>Part,</hi> if the bloody Maſſacre in 1641, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> proceeded
not from any depravity from Principles of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, nor from any ſpirit of
revenge or perſonal hatred againſt the Proteſtants, but only from their
bloody Tenents in matters of Religion, as you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm; it were neceſſary to
inſtance what Points of their Religion they are that render them ſo
dangerous, they profeſſing themſelves Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Anſwer,</p>
                        <p>As I there hint, it is not the Religion of the Church of
<hi>Rome, viz.</hi> what relates to Faith and Worſhip, but the Policies of
the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> that renders them ſo incompatible with civil
Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and humane Society: multitudes of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans live ſafely amongſt
Turks and Pagans in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, Africa</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> without
danger of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres or Aſſaſſinations on the account of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
though they have no Law of true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to influence them, yet the Law of
Humanity is not wholly obliterated; they know what it is to do as they would be
done by; as <hi>Gage</hi> and other Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians of the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt
Indians</hi> inform us, thoſe miſerable Pagans will ask what place the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> goes to after death, vehemently decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, they will not
worſhip that God whoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61834:208"/>are ſo cruel,
leſt they ſhould be as barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly uſed by them in the other
world.</p>
                        <p>And as their inhumane bloody cruelty is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the
Law of Nature, ſo much more by all moral and divine Laws.</p>
                        <p>Therefore what I ſhall inſiſt on ſhall be ſuch
Tenents as are not only againſt all Chriſtian but Moral Principles, nay
againſt the common Law of Nature and Nations, ſuch as render humane

Principles are confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by; and by which they are grown ſo preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous
as to excommunicate all the Chriſtians in the world for damned Hereticks that
diſown the Pope; though they cannot be ignorant that their Principles and
communion are rejected by far the greater number of Chriſtians in the world,

that the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople, &amp;c.</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicates the

1. <hi>p.</hi> 204. to 208. which I there inſerted to this end, that you may
obſerve, all Papiſts are not Jeſuited Papiſts: it was evident in the
laſt <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion, a conſiderable number of the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Nobility and Gentry, not only diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, but violently
oppoſed the Nuntio's party, who copied out the Jeſuits Principles and
Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; as you may read in <hi>Borlacy's Hiſtory of the Iriſh 
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:61834:222"/>Wars</hi> in 1649, 6150, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in this
laſt <hi>Iriſh</hi> Plot I have heard ſeveral of good Rank of their party
ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently declare their abhorrency of it: but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of their Clergy have
been Diſcoverers and Witneſſes againſt their Primate <hi>Plunket,
&amp;c.</hi> which nothing could move them to but Duty, ſome of them being in
a plentiful condition, and titular Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitaries in their Church, are thereby
reduced to great wants, even to extremity, the more is the pity.</p>
                     <p>And as their Principles have been deteſted, ſo their
Practices have been reſiſted, and their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons baniſhed all Popiſh
Realms and States, as faſt as they diſcerned their deſtructive

                     <p n="1">1. The State of <hi>Venice</hi> did not only baniſh

                     <p n="1">1. THey reduce Humanity into a condition worſe than

                     <p n="2">2. Theſe Principles lay the Ax to the root of the
tree of all Morality; not only the common Law of Nature but of Nations is
abrogated, that which diſtinguiſheth betwixt barbarous and civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized

                        <pb n="226" facs="tcp:61834:224"/>3. Theſe Principles abrogate
the Law of God, the Standard of all human Laws, like thoſe Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees
Chriſt condemned <hi>Mark</hi> 7.9. <hi>Ye reject the Commandments of God,
that you may keep your own Tradition,</hi> v. 12. <hi>making the Word of God
void and of none effect by your Traditions,</hi> v. 13. it is not how it is

                     </p>
                     <p>Now thoſe Principles who thus make void all Laws, and
indemnifie their Votaries under all tranſgreſſions againſt them,
conſequently are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Principles: of which <hi>Daniel</hi> propheſies
<hi>chap.</hi> 7.25. of the man of ſin, <hi>He ſhall ſpeak great words

manifeſt <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. in their Principles, and <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. in

                     <p>Which are aggravated to the height of impiety by their

                     <p>The bloody Maſſacre of <hi>Paris</hi> on our pious Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> and the Calviniſts; for which (ſaith my Author) all the

menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſo ignoble and barbarous a Tragedy acted on the ſtage of the

ſo never was the contrivance of any affair more notorious than that: we never
read that ever Pagan, much leſs Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Prince, that laid ſo many
ſnares, broke ſo many ſolemn oaths and promiſes as <hi>Charles</hi> the

many brave Princes, and (as ſome ſay) above an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of his
Subjects in a few days. <hi>vide Thuan. Hiſt. lib.</hi> 52.</p>
                     <p>The Gunpowder Treaſon (if it had hit) had been charged

                     <p>Their laſt bloody Plot, though after full Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by
two Parliaments, declared both by King and Parliament to be evidently a

                     <p>But that ſo many high born Heroick Princes 
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:61834:228"/>ſhould ſo baſely crouch to the uſurped Power of
ſuch inſolent, imperious Peaſants, as many of thoſe Popes have been, is
prodigious and only to be aſcribed to that divine Judgment threatned on them,
<hi>that the ten Horns ſhall have one mind, and ſhall give their Power and
Strength unto the Beaſt, Revel.</hi> 17.13. but our comfort is, <hi>the

                     <p>But this may be obſerved, as ſoon as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Slaves
to the Pope, they became Tyrants over their own Subjects; the Emperor
<hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, though otherwiſe a brave Prince, and
<hi>Philip</hi> his Son King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who murder'd his own Son,
<hi>vide Urſinus</hi> p. 190. <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, the Duke of

barbarous Inquiſitions, Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions and bloody Wars have made all
Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſwim in Blood ſince they were Vaſſals to his
Holineſs.</p>
                     <p>But theſe things were but the beginning of Chriſtendoms
ſorrows, for the Pope to inſult ſometimes over one Prince, and other
times over another, and not bring all their prophane necks under his holy Feet
at once, were inferior to his infallible Grandeur, his Holineſs by this time
was become his Mightineſs, and reſolved to let the whole Chriſtian world
know his terribleneſs to his<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61834:229"/>rebellious Subjects the
Kings of the Earth, and diſchargeth his thundering Canons, and ſends out
his roaring Bulls againſt all Princes and States that would permit a perſon
to live in their Dominions that ſhould open his mouth againſt or peep into
his Myſtery of Iniquity.</p>
                     <p>But the moſt unchriſtian and treacherous deſign the

them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pit they had digged: alſo they charg'd him to counterfeit the

                     <p>I inſtance in theſe two Preſidents, as being in our
ſight and memories; but if you pleaſe to read the Popes Bulls and
Excommunications, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> againſt any Prince or State, they are all
in the name and for the Glory of God. And if their Piety and Vertue conſiſt
in theſe barbarous inhumane Treaſons and Maſſacres, what ſhall we
think of their Vice and Wickedneſs?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As their Blaſphemy againſt God muſt be
believed for Piety, ſo their moſt horrid Treaſons againſt Princes,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt be eſteemed Loyalty; in which multitudes of

need not go far from home to find them: for all their Rebellions againſt the
King, and moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous inhumane Cruelties exerciſed upon his moſt
loyal Subjects in <hi>Ireland</hi> did they tranſact in the Kings Name, to
which they counterfeited his Great Seal, <hi>vide Borlacy</hi> fol. 29. and
declared all they did was for the Kings Service. See their Remonſtrance at
<hi>Trim March</hi> 17. 1642. with their other Addreſſes, but eſpecially
the grand Bond of their Catholick Confederacy, their Oath of Aſſociation,
they declare thus in the Preamble, <hi>As alſo for the defence and

life, defend, uphold and maintain all his juſt Prerogatives, Eſtates and
Rights,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now to ſay this in that very act in which the Bond of
their treaſonable Rebellion conſiſted, which after the greateſt
deliberation they agreed to publiſh, in contempt of the Kings Laws and
Soveraign Power, puts dull Hereticks to a ſtand what to make of Popiſh
Loyalty; unleſs they can loyally riſe in Rebellion againſt their King,
and barbarouſly murder two or three hundred thouſand of his loyal Subjects
for his Honour and Service. Sir <hi>John Temple</hi> p. 6.</p>
                     <p>The Lords of the Pale deſired Commiſſions and Arms to

                     <p>Take but a brief view of their Behaviour after the Peace was

                     <p n="1">1. They treacherouſly contrived to cut off the Lord

been cut off in their Retreat from paſſage; were theſe things for His

                     <p>Nay from that time all their Affronts, Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and
Contempts put upon the Kings Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in the Perſons of the Marqueſſes
of <hi>Ormond</hi> and <hi>Clanriccard,</hi> were ſtill for the Kings
Service, you may read in <hi>Borlace</hi>'s <hi>Hiſtory of the Years</hi>
1650, 1651.</p>
                     <p>When not only the Lord Lieutenant was day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affronted, to
that height as is not to be parallell'd for Rudeneſs and Ingratitude, and
after all his patience, bearing with and winking at ſo many repeated affronts
(which his high Spirit would have diſdained the leaſt part of, if the Kings
Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt had not weighed down all) they excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated and rejected his
Perſon and Authority with all imaginary reproach and ſlander. <hi>vide
Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi> 259. to 273. but it was ſtill for the Kings Service.</p>
                     <p>And little better Treatment did that moſt loyal and
upright Catholick Peer, the Marqueſs of <hi>Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riccard,</hi> meet with from
his Countrymen. <hi>vide id.</hi> 291. to 295.</p>
                     <p>But after all, for that unpardonable ſin of Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> was excommunicated, as a Contemner of the Authority of the

                        <pb n="252" facs="tcp:61834:237"/>But all theſe intolerable Affronts
and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts put on the Kings Authority from the Peace 1648. was only by the
Clergy and Nuntio's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for not only the Marqueſs of <hi>Clanriccard</hi>
but many other Catholick Noblemen and Gentlemen, with a conſiderable party of
the Popiſh Army ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered ſtedfaſtly to the Kings Authority to the laſt;
the other only pretended to it.</p>
                     <p>Which fully evidenceth, all Papiſts (as is before
aſſerted) are not Jeſuited Papiſts. And it would be better both for
themſelves and us, if they would more viſibly diſtinguiſh themſelves,
that we might know our Fiends from our Enemies.</p>
                     <p>My Opinion is, thoſe Subjects indulged by their Prince in
the Liberty of their Conſciences ought not only to explode all pernicious
Principles to the Peace of his State in themſelves, but detect them where
they diſcover them in others of their Sect or Perſuaſion; or otherwiſe
they juſtly ſuffer thoſe Miſeries that ſhall enſue by their
neglect: for though Unity in Religion is an excellent bond for Chriſtian
neighbourly Society, where it can be obtained without violence to Reaſon and
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                     <p>Yet I judge an Unity in Loyalty, that is, mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to
adhere to the Civil Conſtitutions of the Government they live under is much
more ſteddy and ſafe: Civil Intereſt being much more incluſive and
leſs diſputable than Religious: for ſince St. <hi>Paul</hi> withſtood
St. <hi>Peter</hi> to the Face, <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.11. and that ſharp
Contention betwixt Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> on which they
ſeparated <hi>Acts</hi> 15.39.<pb n="253" facs="tcp:61834:237"/>I do not find either in
ſacred or other Hiſtory, but there hath been Contentions and Diviſions in
the Church: but ſtill their Civil Intereſt was the ſame againſt Pagan
Perſecutors, until that wicked Error of the <hi>Arrians</hi> became potent,
and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Orthodox, ſince which time that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Spirit
of Perſecution hath rendered Chriſtians leſs ſociable than Pagans.</p>
                     <p>That were I to chooſe my Habitation in the world, I
ſhould think my ſelf more ſafe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable in the Neighbourhood of
moral Turks, or Heathens, that retain the Principles of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, than
amongſt ſuch Chriſtians as the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Prophet foretold, <hi>that
ſhall hate me and perſecute me for Gods Name ſake, ſaying, let the Lord
be glorified, Iſaiah</hi> 66.5. and alſo our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour ſaith,
<hi>the time cometh that whoſoever killeth you will think they do God good
Service;</hi> which muſt intend the true God: which Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are fulfilled
by Papal <hi>Rome;</hi> Pagan <hi>Rome</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pretended Gods Service:
which Principle of Perſecution hath been the cauſe of ſhedding <hi>Seas
of Blood in Chriſtendom</hi> this laſt thouſand years: and (as I
elſewhere ſhew) is more pernicious to civil Peace when Subjects rebel
againſt their Prince under pretence of Religion, than when Princes puniſh
their Subjects for their Differing Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                     <p>For we read of frequent Conceſſions and Grants of
Liberty from Princes, but rarely of Submiſſion in Subjects taking Arms for
Defence of Religion, until the Country hath been near<pb n="254" facs="tcp:61834:238"/>deſolated: therefore happy is that Kingdom, or State, where Prince
and Subjects are united in one common bottom of <hi>National Relation and
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> which no pretence of Religion can diſſolve or perplex.
Hiſtory informs us of Chriſtian Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians that fought under the Banners of
their Pagan Princes to defend the Intereſt of their Prince and Country from
Invaſions. <hi>vid the Life of Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p> 
                        <hi>Since Gods Word requires us not only to pray for but
ſeek the Peace of the Country wherein we are Captives, that in their Peace we
may have Peace; how much more our native Country, under the Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of our

                     </p>
                     <p>But with Papiſts, as I ſhewed before, no
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Deſcent, nor legal Election, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can ſecure
a Prince from the Rebellion of his Subjects, if Religion come in competition.
And it is not only a Hereſie in Civils, but in Religion, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in any
caſe, that Subjects may rebel againſt their lawful Prince to propagate
Religion; againſt which there is as poſitive expreſs Precepts in the
Divine Law, as againſt any one Wickedneſs there forbidden, which is ſo

paſſions of Joy, not only by thoſe<pb n="267" facs="tcp:61834:244"/>that expected
Gain and Advancement, but by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that knew they ſhould ſuffer Loſs as
to their private Fortunes; yet were ſo weary of their paſt and then
preſent Confuſion, and ſo well ſatisfied in the Kings Gratious
Declarations and Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they could and did ſay, as
<hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, For as much as our Lord the
King is come again in peace, let</hi> Zibah <hi>take all,</hi> let Royaliſts
(but not Papiſts) take our Crown and Biſhops Lands, our Regiments and
Troops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> our Hearts ſhall joyn with our Hands, to lift the
King into his Throne, (which we defie all other Hands to do without us) ſo
<hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> may be once more ſettled.</p>
                     <p>And with what mutual content both King and People have
enjoyed each other till the very day this laſt Hell-hatch'd Plot broke out is
notorious to all <hi>Europe</hi> as well as <hi>Great Britain</hi> and
<hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> till then we heard of no Court nor Country Parties, no
Whiggs nor Tories, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in <hi>Irelands</hi> Boggs,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> no Petitioners, Abhorrers, or Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, but what the
King was pleaſed with, no exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting penal Laws on Diſſenters; but on the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, Subjects entirely and univerſally endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Prince, in his
own nature, compounded of of Tenderneſs and Sympathy, <hi>pleading with
Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments againſt penal Statutes; and propoſing to their
Conſideration, that ſome Proviſion might be made to enable him to
diſpence with ſuch Proteſtants, who through miſguided Conſcience
could not conform to the Ceremonies, Diſcipline,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of the
Church, vid. Speeches Octob.</hi> 26. 1662. and again <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. 1678.
His Majeſty did not only preſs the Houſe, but alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded 
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:61834:245"/>the Lord Chancellor <hi>to commend to their
conſideration, not only what might tend to preſerve the Proteſtant
Religion in general, but for an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt all ſorts of Proteſtants
to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Popiſh and other Recuſants, between them that
would deſtroy the whole Flock and them that only wander from it,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And though Parliaments were not then inclined to ſo great
Moderation; yet hath His Majeſty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged Diſſenters, and ſuſpended
the Execution of penal Statutes againſt them in a great meaſure, for
theſe twenty years paſt; and more particularly hath govern'd this Kingdom
by Lord Lieutenants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that have imitated his Royal Clemency to
the utmoſt Diſſenters could expect, that they would ſhew themſelves
the moſt ungrateful, diſingenious people in the world to be diſloyal, or
give the Government the leaſt cauſe of Jealouſie of them.</p>
                     <p>As I obſerved before, their Intereſt is as entirely
involved in the Safety of the Crown and Potency of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Proteſtant Intereſt, as the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts themſelves, and they
contentedly ſee them- enjoy all Honours and beneficial Offices, either Civil,
Eccleſiaſtical or Military, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and
chearfully perform their Duties in all troubleſome and chargeable Services to
their King and Country, and deſire no greater Reward than that their Loyalty
may not be ſuſpected till they give cauſe.</p>
                     <p>And notwithſtanding they may be diſſatisfied with
ſome things relating to the Hirarchy and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial part of the
eſtabliſhed Religion, yet not to<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61834:245"/>that height, but they
will allow there is a neceſſity of a National Religion, to prevent
Atheiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if ſo, it follows, there is the like
neceſſity of a National Conſtitution and Diſcipline to prevent
Confuſion; and until the Wiſdom of the Nation in Parliament ſee cauſe
to reform things ſome think amiſs, moſt Diſſenters judge it their
Intereſt as well as their Duty, to ſupport the Proteſtant Church as now
eſtabliſhed againſt all illegal Oppoſition what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, as the
Bulwark of the Proteſtant Religion in <hi>Ireland</hi> againſt Popery and
Confuſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is not any thing the Conformiſts can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign for
the promotion of Godlineſs, which is the chief end of all Forms, but the
ſober Nonconfor-heartily joyn with them; ſo that the pious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts
and Nonconformiſts are both of the ſame true Religion, pertakers of the
ſame Grace on earth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.7. and Heirs of the ſame Glory in
Heaven, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. And the impious of both ſorts of one falſe
Religion, pertakers of the ſame ſpirit of Formality and Hypocriſie on
Earth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and ſhall receive the ſame Condemnation,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.17. <hi>John</hi> 5.29.</p>
                     <p>And if this hath been and is the caſe of the
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland, &amp;c.</hi> can they be blamed
for expreſſing a ſence of their Damage and Danger by the Jeſuited
Papiſts their Neighbours, eſpecially when ſometimes from the Pulpit, and
other times from the Bench, they are repreſented to be as dangerous perſons
as themſelves, and that is dangerous enough, if it were true, and whatever
their Proteſtant Neighbours apprehend of them,<pb n="270" facs="tcp:61834:246"/>their
Popiſh will believe it; becauſe they proved the moſt dangerous Hereticks
to them, from the year 1649 to 1653. that ever they met with in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> (but I hope the Proteſtant Intereſt fares not the worſe
for that:) and therefore would be as glad to ſee Bonefires made of them, as
their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors were of <hi>Cranmer, Ridley</hi> and <hi>Latimer,
&amp;c.</hi> being convinc'd, burning ſuch ſurly ſtubborn He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks by
three or four at a time is a more ſafe way than ſighting them with the
Kings Commiſſion in their Pockets.</p>
                     <p>But from the whole I argue, it is the Intereſt of the
Loyal moral Papiſts of <hi>Ireland</hi> above all the Papiſts in the world
to diſown and reject the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits Principles expreſſed <hi>Sect.</hi>
1. from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of theſe paſt woful conſequences not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Proteſtants, but to the total ruine of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Noble &amp;
Worſhipful Catholick Families, many of whom are utterly extinct, and others
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a very mean and contemptible ſtate, to what their Anceſtors
enjoyed. And if ſo;

                     <p>And if this hath been the iſſue of their former

deſperate Attempt? for (as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<pb n="271" facs="tcp:61834:246"/>aſſerted) it
muſt be an Have at all; another ſuch Act as that of <hi>Decimo
ſeptimo</hi> would not leave a nocent Papiſt an Acre of Land in

                     <p>And therefore I aſſert it their Intereſt above all the

<hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 93, 94. and then, though we retain different
